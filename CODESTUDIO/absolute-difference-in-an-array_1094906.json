I apologize I thought we should return the running absolute difference when actually asked is the largest difference from the first number at even/odd places. lets start over again for this question. absolute difference of elements at even positions will be : |5 - 3| = 2, |5 - 2| = 3.Hence our answer will be 3.\n\nOdd positions: 4, 4. |4-4| = 0. Hence our answer will be 0. so max difference is 3 and 0. This result is incorrect as our code expects result of 0 0 from the sample tests. The given problem statement asks for the running absolute difference between consecutive numbers after abs function is applied. so from example 1 above |5-3| = 2 and then |2-2| = 0 hence the answer would be 0. from example 1 above |4-4| = 0 hence the answer would be 0"
