Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that it may be possible that two accounts belong to the same name, but they may belong to different people, as people could have the same name.</h4>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-person-could-have-any-number-of-accounts-initially-but-all-their-accounts-definitely-have-the-same-name\">A person could have any number of accounts initially, but all their accounts definitely have the same name.</h4>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"after-merging-the-accounts-you-have-to-return-an-array-list-of-merged-accounts-where-each-account-the-first-element-is-the-persons-name-and-the-rest-elements-are-the-email-addresses-in-sorted-order-non-decreasing-accounts-themselves-can-be-in-any-order\">After merging the accounts, you have to return an array/list of merged accounts where each account, the first element is the person&#39;s name, and the rest elements are the email addresses in sorted order (non-decreasing).
