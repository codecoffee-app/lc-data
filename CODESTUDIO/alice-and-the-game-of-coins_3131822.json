In one move, a person can move any special coin to make it not special. And after movement, according to its updated position, it should not be a special coin again. If there is no possible move, the game will be stopped.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"alice-has-to-tell-bob-the-maximum-and-a-minimum-number-of-coins-can-be-moved\">Alice has to tell Bob the maximum, and a minimum number of coins can be moved.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-help-alice-to-find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-coins-that-can-be-moved\">Your task is to help Alice to find the minimum and maximum number of coins that can be moved.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">EXAMPLE:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: &#39;N&#39; = 3, &#39;COINS&#39; = [8, 5, 10]\nOutput: Maximum = 2, Minimum = 1\n\nAlice can move 5 -&gt; 9 for one move, and then the game will be stopped.\nAlso, she can move 10 -&gt; 6, 5 -&gt; 7 for two moves, and then the game will be stopped.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases. \n\nFor each test case, the first line contains an integer &#39;N&#39; denoting that number of coins placed.
