You have given the points array \u2018POINTS\u2019 having \u2018N\u2019 vertices which denote the coordinates in the X-Y plane of the fence and the coordinates of the animal \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019. The width of the fence is very large so the points present on the fence are considered to be inside. Find if the given animal is safe from monsters or not.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019, representing the number vertices of the fence.\n\nThe next \u2018N\u2019 lines will denote the coordinates of the fence in the X-Y place.\n\nThe \u2018N + 1\u2019th line will denote the coordinates of the animal in the X-Y plane.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return a single integer \u20181\u2019 if the animal is safe, else print \u20180\u2019.\n\nPrint output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
