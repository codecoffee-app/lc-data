You have given the points array \u2018POINTS\u2019 having \u2018N\u2019 vertices which denote the coordinates in the X-Y plane of the fence and the coordinates of the animal \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019. The width of the fence is very large so the points present on the fence are considered to be inside.
