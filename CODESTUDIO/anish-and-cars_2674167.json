The ith car starts in a unique position POSITION[i] and has a unique speed SPEED[i]. Every car starts driving at the same time after the gun is fired and stops at the point of destination D. However, this competition has a unique rule: no car can overtake any other car.

Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 denoting the number of cars and the point of destination respectively.\n\nThe next line of every test case contains \u2018N\u2019 integers containing the POSITIONS of the ith car.\n\nThe next line of every test case contains \u2018N\u2019 integers containing the SPEEDS of the ith car.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the number of unique arrivals of the cars.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
