However, he also has to complete his maths homework. His maths teacher has given him an array and asked him to reorder the array in such a way that the following is satisfied.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"let-b1-be-the-mex-of-the-elements-arr1\">Let B1 be the MEX of the elements [ARR1].</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"let-b2-be-the-mex-of-the-elements-arr1-arr2\">Let B2 be the MEX of the elements [ARR1, ARR2].</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"let-bn-be-the-mex-of-the-elements-arr1-arr2-arrn\">Let Bn be the MEX of the elements [ARR1, ARR2, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..
