Now his teacher has given the assignment to implement N stacks in a single array of length L. Since he has been very inattentive in his data structure classes, he can\u2019t solve the problem on his own. Can you help him out?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let, \n\nN = 5\nL = 10\n1 1 3 [PUSH (1 ,4)]\n1 1 4 [PUSH (1 ,3)] \n2 1 [POP(1)] \n2 2 2 [PUSH(2,2)] \n2 2 [POP(2)]\n\nAnswer:- [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\n (The first stack has 4 and 3 so 4 is popped out from stack 1 and stack 2 has integer 2 in it, so 2 is popped out from stack 2) .\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \u2018L\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, and \u2018Q\u2019 denoting the number of stacks to be implemented and the number of queries to be performed.\n\nThe next \u2018Q\u2019 lines of every test case contain 3 integers \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, and \u2018C\u2019 denoting the type of operation, the stack number on which the operation is to be achieved, and the number to be pushed if \u2018A\u2019 is 1.\n\nThe next \u2018Q\u2019 lines of every test case contain 2 integers \u2018A\u2019, and \u2018B\u2019 denoting the type of operation, and the stack number on which the operation is to be achieved if &#39;A&#39; is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the number popped out if \u2018A\u2019 is 2 if there exists a number in the stack otherwise print -1. If \u2018A\u2019 is 1, if the push operation is successful, print 0, otherwise print -1 if the stack is full.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= L &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= A &lt;= 2\n1 &lt;= B &lt;= N\n1 &lt;= C &lt;= 10^9  \n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n10 1 5\n1 1 1\n1 1 3\n2 1\n2 1\n2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n0\n3\n1\n-1 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first two operations, the answer should be 0 because the push operations are performed successfully. Then for the next two operations, the numbers 3 and 1 are popped out and they are printed. In the last operation, -1 is printed because the stack is already empty.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n10 2 1\n2 2 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>-1\n</code></pre>\n",
