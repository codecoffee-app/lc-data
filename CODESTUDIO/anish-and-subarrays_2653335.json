However, his brother is sometimes very inattentive. So, he wants to test whether his brother has understood the concept of sub-arrays or not. He gives his brother two numbers and asks him to find the number of sub-arrays of a certain array ARR such that the maximum element of the sub-array lies between X and Y.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let, \n\nARR = [2, 1, 4, 3]\nX = 2 , Y = 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Answer:- 3 (The sub-arrays which meet the requirements are [2], [2, 1], [3]).</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \u2018N\u2019, \u2018X\u2019, and \u2018Y\u2019 denoting the length of the array given and the two integers.\n\nThe next line of every test case contains \u2018N\u2019 integers containing the elements of the array arr.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the number of sub-arrays that has a maximum between X and Y.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n4 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= ARR[i] &lt;= 10^9   \nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 1 3\n1 2 3\n4 2 3\n10 2 3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>6\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the answer should be 6 because every sub-array satisfies the conditions.\nIn the second test case, the answer should be 3 because the sub-arrays [2], [3], and [2, 3] satisfy the conditions.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n4 1 2\n4 3 6 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n</code></pre>\n",
