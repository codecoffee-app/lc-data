His work is about to finish. There are &#39;M&#39; free apartments in the society. The size of each of the apartments is given in an array &#39;apartmentSize&#39;. He put an online ad for the sale of flats in the society. He received &#39;N&#39; applications with the desired size of the apartments needed for each applicant. The desired size of the apartments for each applicant is given in an array \u2018desiredSize\u2019. Ninja is also provided with an integer &#39;K&#39;. For any applicant with the desired size of the apartment =  D, he will buy the apartment if the size of the apartment lies in between D - K and D + K (both inclusive). He wants to distribute the apartments in such a manner that he can sell as many apartments as possible.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-is-very-busy-finishing-the-construction-works-can-you-help-ninja-to-calculate-the-maximum-number-of-apartments-he-can-sell\">Ninja is very busy finishing the construction works.

So, the answer is 2 in this case.\n\nIn the second test case, there are 3 applicants with the desired size of apartments as 5, 7, and 8, respectively. The number of apartments available is 3, with the size of the apartments as 15, 20, and 15 respectively. He will not be able to sell any apartment as the desired apartment size is not in the given range of the sizes of the apartments.
