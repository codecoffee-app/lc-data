So we skip the first 3 nodes(1-&gt;2-&gt;3). The value of &#39;N&#39; is 2, hence we add the next 2 nodes(4-&gt;5). The sum is 9, so we add 9 after node 5. Now repeating the same process again, we skip the next 3 nodes(6-&gt;7-&gt;8). Now we add the next 2 nodes(9-&gt;10), for which the sum is 19. Hence we add 19 to the list after 10. Now while skipping the next 3 nodes we encounter the end of a linked list, hence the updated linked list is our answer.\n\nIn test case 2, for the linked list,  the value of &#39;M&#39; is 3. So we skip the first 3 nodes(5-&gt;4-&gt;3). The value of &#39;N&#39; is 4 so ideally we should add the next 4 nodes, but there are only two nodes remaining before we encounter the end of the linked list, hence we add those 2 nodes(7-&gt;9). The sum is 16, therefore we add 16 to the end of the linked list. Because we have encountered the end of the linked list, the updated linked list is our answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n10 30 10 40 5 5 -1\n2 3\n1 -2 1 2 2 -4 2 4 -1\n2 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>10 30 10 40 5 45 5 \n1 -2 1 2 2 -4 -2 2 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-the-sample-output-2\">Explanation of the Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In test case 1, for the linked list,  the value of &#39;M&#39; is 3.
