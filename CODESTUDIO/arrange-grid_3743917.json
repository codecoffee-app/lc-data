He gets a box of some toys. The box looks like a grid &#39;B&#39; consisting of &#39;N&#39; rows and &#39;M&#39; columns, and each cell has exactly one toy. His task is to arrange these toys on the shelf &#39;S&#39; in front of him, which is empty. The shelf has &#39;R&#39; rows and &#39;C&#39; columns. Help your friend to arrange the toys on the shelf &#39;S&#39; in the same row-order traversal as in the box &#39;B&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-the-box-arrangement-of-toys-in-a-matrix-of-size-n-m-where-values-in-the-matrix-are-integers-and-denote-the-ids-of-toys-your-task-is-to-return-a-matrix-of-size-r-c-denoting-the-shelf-arrangement-of-toys\">You are given the box arrangement of toys in a matrix of size &#39;N * M&#39; where values in the matrix are integers and denote the IDs of toys.
