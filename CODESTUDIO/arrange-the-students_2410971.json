All you have to do is to arrange them in such a way that students having fewer pens always come before the students having the greater number of pens. If two or more students having the same total number of pens then the one having more blue pens will come first.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018STUDENTS\u2019 = [[2, 3], [5, 1], [1, 2], [4, 1]]\n\u2018ANS\u2019 = [[1, 2], [4, 1], [2, 3], [5, 1]]\n\nHere, STUDENTS[i][0] and STUDENTS[i][1] represent the blue and black pens student \u2018i\u2019 have, respectively.\n\u2018STUDENTS\u2019 in terms of the total number of pens students have = [[5], [6], [3], [5]]\nArrange according to the requirement = [[3], [5], [5], [7]]. The fourth student will come before the first student as he has more blue pens.\nTherefore, the final answer is [[1, 2], [4, 1], [2, 3], [5, 1]].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case has an integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the size of \u2018STUDENTS\u2019.\n\nThe next \u2018N\u2019 lines have two single space-separated integers \u2018BLUE\u2019 and \u2018BLACK\u2019 which represent the blue and black pens \u2018i-th\u2019 student has, respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u2018N\u2019 lines each having two integers separated by a single space representing the blue and black pens that the \u2018i-th\u2019 student has, under the condition given in the description.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print the output, it has already been taken care of.
