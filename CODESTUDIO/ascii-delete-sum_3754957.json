Your task is to delete a few characters (possibly 0) from both strings to make the strings equal. The characters you delete must have the minimum possible sum of their ASCII values.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given str1=\u2019abc\u2019, str2=\u2019bcd\u2019, Here to make the string equal, we have to delete \u2018a\u2019 from str1 and \u2018d\u2019 from str2, which will add 97 and 100 to the answer. Hence the answer is 197\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018t\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string representing the string \u2018str1.\u2019\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single string representing the string \u2018str2.\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer representing the minimum sum of ASCII characters to delete to make both strings equal.\n\nPrint a separate line for each test case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function and return the answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= str1.size(), str2.size() &lt;= 1000\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nabc\nbcd\naaab\naaa\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>197\n98\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, str1=\u2019abc\u2019, str2=\u2019bcd\u2019, Here to make the string equal, we have to delete \u2018a\u2019 from str1 and \u2018d\u2019 from str2, which will add 97 and 100 to the answer. Hence the answer is 197.\n\nFor the second test case, str1=\u2019aaab\u2019, str2=\u2019aaa\u2019, Here to make the string equal, we can only delete one character \u2018b\u2019 from str2, which has an ASCII value of 98.
