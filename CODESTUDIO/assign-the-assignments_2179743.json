This fulfills B=2 only if X<=10 and A=2 only if X>=14. This is not possible, however X = 12 assigns tasks [12, 16, 14] to Ninja and [10] to his friend. X can also be set to 13 so X=[12,13]. This splits the array into [10] (friend), [12,14,16] (Ninja). Tasks are assigned only on if they are greater than or equal to X. So with X = 12 or 13 Ninja can get 2 tasks."
