For this, he assigns a few beast titans, on each level, a titan defends the Kingdom that is represented by a rectangular grid of cells. If a titan takes a position in some cells of the grid, then this titan defends all the cells in the same row and the same column. No two titans share a row or a column. The penalty of the position is the number of cells in the largest undefended rectangle.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The given figure has titans at coordinates at (3,8) and (8,6) and (11,2).
