Your task is to find the average of all the levels in the given tree, i.e you have to find the average of all the node values present on the level, for each level.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"two-nodes-of-a-tree-are-said-to-be-at-the-same-level-k-if-both-of-them-are-at-equal-distance-k-from-the-root-node-the-root-node-is-said-to-be-at-level-0\">Two nodes of a tree are said to be at the same level \u2018K\u2019  if both of them are at equal distance( &#39;K&#39; ) from the &#39;ROOT&#39; node. The &#39;ROOT&#39; node is said to be at level 0.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. Two nodes may have the same value associated with it.\n2. Average of any level is computed as the sum of the values of all the nodes at that level divided by the number of nodes at that level.\n3. You will be given the &#39;ROOT&#39; node of the binary tree.\n4. You need to print the floor value for each average. For example,  if the average of node values at some level is 3.5 then you have to print 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer &#39;N&#39; denoting the number of nodes in the tree. \n\nThe second line contains the values of the nodes of the tree in the level order form ( -1 for NULL node) \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the binary tree\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-from-2020-10-09-12-55-45-5134.png\" alt=\"altImage\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>The input of the tree depicted in the image above will be like : \n\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first non-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level.
