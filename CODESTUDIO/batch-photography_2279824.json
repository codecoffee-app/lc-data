Alex has \u2018N\u2019 photos, whose resolution is given in an integer array \u2018photos\u2019. The machine has some downsides as well. The error in photocopying a batch is the absolute difference between the highest resolution photo and the lowest resolution photo in the batch.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-alex-will-divide-the-photos-into-some-groups-of-size-at-least-k-and-feed-it-to-the-machine-the-maximum-error-is-the-maximum-of-the-errors-from-each-batch-he-wants-to-minimize-the-maximum-error-can-you-help-him-divide-the-photos-into-batches-efficiently-and-tell-him-the-minimum-maximum-error-he-can-achieve\">Now Alex will divide the photos into some groups of size at least \u2018K\u2019 and feed it to the machine. The maximum error is the maximum of the errors from each batch. He wants to minimize the maximum error. Can you help him divide the photos into batches efficiently and tell him the minimum maximum error he can achieve?</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example-let-the-resolutions-be-1-5-2-and-k-2-so-there-is-only-one-way-of-dividing-the-array-which-is-a-single-group-of-all-three-elements-the-error-is-therefore-5-1-4\">Example: Let the resolutions be [1, 5, 2] and K = 2. So there is only one way of dividing the array, which is a single group of all three elements. The error is therefore 5 - 1 = 4.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, denoting the number of photos and the minimum size of each batch.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains an array \u2018photos\u2019 of \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers, denoting the resolution of the ith photo.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the minimum \u2018maximum error\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output.

The processing time of the first group is 10, and the processing time of the second group is 20. The maximum between 10 and 20 is 20. It is impossible to split the photos into groups in such a way that the processing time of division is less than 20.\nIn the second test case, the photos should be split into four groups, each containing one photo. So the minimal possible processing time of a division is 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5 2\n5 7 3 3 5\n3 2\n1 2 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\n</code></pre>\n",
