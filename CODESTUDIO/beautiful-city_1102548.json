Each house in the city is connected via roads with at most two houses and forms a binary tree-like structure such that  Kth level can have at most 2 ^ K houses. Now, the problem in the city is that persons from different houses at the same level can not meet without changing their level. Ninja wants to make this city beautiful by connecting houses at the same level. As Ninja is busy preparing for his travel, he gives this task to you. Can you help Ninja to make this city beautiful?</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-figure-a-represents-the-city-before-making-it-beautiful-figure-b-represents-a-beautiful-city-because-all-the-houses-on-the-same-level-are-connected\">For example Figure A represents the city before making it Beautiful.
