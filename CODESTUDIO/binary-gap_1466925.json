He is just one step away from making his dream come true, but hold the line, Hu-chan\u2019s master knows all his weaknesses and is going to do a final test of his skills before he is announced as the greatest ninja ever.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"master-is-aware-of-ninja-hu-chan-s-rivalry-with-maths-and-therefore-he-gives-him-a-mathematical-problem-to-solve-being-a-good-friend-and-well-wisher-of-our-ninja-can-you-help-him-solve-the-problem-assigned-and-thus-acclaim-the-title-of-the-greatest-ninja\">Master is aware of Ninja Hu-chan\u2019s rivalry with maths and therefore he gives him a mathematical problem to solve, being a good friend and well-wisher of our Ninja, can you help him solve the problem assigned and thus acclaim the title of the greatest ninja?</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-problem-read-as-follows\">The problem read as follows:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-a-number-num-return-the-maximum-distance-between-any-two-adjacent-1s-in-the-binary-representation-of-num\">You are given a number \u2018NUM\u2019, return the maximum distance between any two adjacent 1s in the binary representation of &#39;NUM&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The two 1s are called adjacent if there isn\u2019t another 1 between them.
