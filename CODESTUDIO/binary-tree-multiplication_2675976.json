Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the elements of the binary tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\n\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/binary_tree_multiplication2-13483.png\"/> </p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n-1 4 5 -1\n-1 -1 -1 -1\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = null (-1)\nRight child of 2 = 4\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\n\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n\nNote: The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \n\nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n\n1 2 3 -1 4 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer denoting the sum of multiplication of each node with its mirror node.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
