But, learning that alone won\u2019t help the ninja since a lot of problems are required to be solved as homework. Since the ninja is old-fashioned and doesn\u2019t know that a computer can do the same homework in a matter of a few seconds you will have to help with the problems.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-need-to-complete-a-function-for-the-ninja-that-can-calculate-the-binomial-of-a-number-where-when-given-two-integers-n-and-r-the-program-can-calculate-its-respective-binomial-coefficient-ncr-since-the-answer-may-be-very-large-calculate-the-answer-modulo-10-9-7\">You need to complete a function for the ninja that can calculate the binomial of a number where when given two integers &#39;N&#39; and &#39;R&#39;,  the program can calculate its respective binomial coefficient nCr. Since the answer may be very large, calculate the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: &#39;N&#39; = 5, &#39;R&#39; = 2\nOutput: 10\n\nThe value of 5C2 is 10\nAfter taking the modulo with 10^9 + 7 we get 10.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run. Then the &#39;T&#39; test case are as follows.\n\nThe first line of each test contains an integer &#39;N&#39; and an integer \u2018R\u2019, both separated by a space.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, print its binomial coefficient nCr modulo 10^9 + 7. \n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
