Each tree has a fruit value associated with it. A ninja bird eyeing the fruits on the tree is blazingly fast. It can sit on a tree for 0.5 sec to gather all the fruits present on the tree no matter the number of fruits present in the tree and then the ninja bird can move to a neighboring tree. It takes the ninja bird 0.5 seconds to move from one tree to another. Once all the fruits are picked from a particular tree, she can\u2019t pick any more fruits from that tree.
