As usual, Bob forgot to do it and asked Alice if he could copy her\u2019s. Alice agreed to help him only if he rearranged the digits of her number such that the new number was strictly greater than the old one. Also, the teacher does not like big numbers, so Bob needs to make sure his number is as small as possible.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"help-bob-rearrange-the-digits-of-alice-s-number-to-make-a-number-greater-than-that-of-alice-and-is-smallest-possible-or-print-1-when-no-such-number-exists\">Help Bob rearrange the digits of Alice\u2019s number to make a number greater than that of Alice and is smallest possible or print -1 when no such number exists.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integers \u2018N\u2019,  denoting Alice\u2019s number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer denoting the final number after rearranging the digits or -1 when no such number exists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output.
