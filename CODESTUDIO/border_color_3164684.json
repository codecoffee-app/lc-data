Identify the connected component containing the cell (`row`, `col`). A connected component consists of cells with the same color that are adjacent (up, down, left, or right).  Color only the border of this connected component with `new_color`. The border of the connected component consists of those cells of the component that have at least one neighbor that is not of the same color as the component, or is out of bounds.
