So he figured out a new board game called &quot;destroy the neighbours&quot;. In this game, there are N integers on a board. In one move, he can pick any integer x from the board, and then all the integers with value x + 1 or x - 1 get destroyed. This move will give him x points.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"he-plays-the-game-until-the-board-becomes-empty-but-as-he-wants-to-show-this-game-to-his-friend-steven-he-wants-to-learn-techniques-to-maximize-the-points-to-show-off-can-you-help-gary-in-finding-out-the-maximum-points-he-receives-from-the-game\">He plays the game until the board becomes empty.

In each move, Gary can choose an integer 'x' from the board and remove all integers with values 'x + 1' or 'x - 1'.  He receives 'x' points for each such move. The game ends when the board is empty.  Given an array of integers representing the numbers on the board, determine the maximum number of points Gary can accumulate by playing the game optimally.",
