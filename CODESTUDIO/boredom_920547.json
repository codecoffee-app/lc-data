So he figured out a new board game called &quot;destroy the neighbours&quot;. In this game, there are N integers on a board. In one move, he can pick any integer x from the board, and then all the integers with value x + 1 or x - 1 get destroyed. This move will give him x points.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"he-plays-the-game-until-the-board-becomes-empty-but-as-he-wants-to-show-this-game-to-his-friend-steven-he-wants-to-learn-techniques-to-maximize-the-points-to-show-off-can-you-help-gary-in-finding-out-the-maximum-points-he-receives-from-the-game\">He plays the game until the board becomes empty.
