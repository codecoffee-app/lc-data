If the queue is full, enqueue request gets blocked until the queue has no empty space i.e the element is stored at some other space and enqueued in the list when there is space in the queue.  \n\nInt Dequeue(): Returns the element at the front of the queue and blocks the dequeue request if there are no items in the queue until the queue has an element enqueued.\n\nInt Size(): Returns the size of the queue.\n\nYou will be given \u2018Q\u2019 queries. You need to implement a bounded blocking queue according to those queries. Each query will belong to one of these two types:\n\n0 \u2018C\u2019: Creates a queue of a capacity \u2018C\u2019.\n\n1 \u2018X\u2019: Enqueue element \u2018X\u2019  into the end of the queue. \n\n2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue. \nReturns -1 if the queue is empty, otherwise, returns the dequeued element.\n\n3: Returns the size of the queue.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of the test cases.\n\nEach of the test cases is described as:\n\nThe first line contains \u2018Q\u2019 denoting the number of queries to be answered.\n\nThe next \u2018Q\u2019 lines specify the type of query to be performed as mentioned above.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, for all the query of type:-\n\n2: Return -1 if the queue is empty otherwise return the dequeued element.\n\n3: Returns the size of the queue.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

I.e 0.\n\nTest Case 2: For this input, we have the number of queries, Q = 4.\n0 2 -&gt; A queue of capacity \u20182\u2019 is initialized.\n2 -&gt; We have to dequeue an element but as the queue is empty this request will go to a blocked state and return -1.\n1 7 -&gt; Enqueue 7 to the queue. Now the blocked request of dequeue will be unblocked So dequeue front element i.e \u20187\u2019 and return it. \n3 -&gt; Return the size of the queue i.e \u20180\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\n0 8\n2\n3\n0 11\n1 4\n1 21\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>-1    \n</code></pre>\n",
