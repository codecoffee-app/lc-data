He has N number of boxes in a row, and each box contains some chocolates. Now, He wants to distribute chocolates to K children keeping in mind that distribution should be as fair as possible. To fairly distribute the gift boxes, he decided to give the maximum number of chocolates equally to K children.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"formally-there-are-n-boxes-with-a-different-number-of-chocolates-in-them-the-task-is-to-divide-the-chocolates-equally-among-k-children-where-you-can-only-choose-consecutive-boxes-subarray-to-distribute-chocolates-you-need-to-print-the-maximum-number-of-chocolates-each-child-can-get\">Formally, There are N boxes with a different number of chocolates in them. The task is to divide the chocolates equally among K children where you can only choose consecutive boxes(subarray) to distribute chocolates. You need to print the maximum number of chocolates each child can get.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-for-the-given-boxes-of-chocolates-3-2-2-5-4-1-and-5-students\">For Example: for the given boxes of chocolates [3,2,2,5,4,1] and 5 students.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Output: 2 \n\nIf there is no restriction on choosing the boxes then the maximum number of chocolates the 5 students equally can have is 3 by picking all boxes except the box at index 2(0-based indexing). So total candies will be 3+2+5+4+1 = 15 and each of the 5 students will get 15/5=3 candies. \n\nBut we are allowed to choose only consecutive boxes. So if we choose boxes [0,1] then 3+2=5 then each student will have only 1 chocolate and when we choose boxes[4,6] as 5+4+1=10 then each student will have 2 chocolates. So the maximum number of chocolates each student can get is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run.\n\nThen the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers N, and K, denoting the total number of boxes and the total number of students respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; single space-separated integers representing the count of chocolates in each of the N boxes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the maximum number of chocolates each child can get in a single line\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= 10^5\n0 &lt;= boxes[i] &lt;= 10^5\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4\n1 2 3 4 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-1\">Explanation for Sample 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, we can choose the boxes [0,4] as 1+2+3+4+5=15  each student will have 5 chocolates.\n\nFor the second test case, You can choose the boxes [2, 4] as 3+4+5=12, each student will have 3 chocolates.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n5 8\n1 2 3 4 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-2\">Explanation for Sample 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, there is no way to choose consecutive boxes and divide chocolates from those boxes equally among 8 students    \n</code></pre>\n",
