After applying the operation, gainPower = [200], power = 250, score = 1.\n\n    Apply operation 1 on the box with power = 200. After applying the operation, gainPower = [], power = 50, score = 2.\n\nHence, the answer is 2.\n\nIn the second test case, there are 4 boxes with power [50, 50, 50, 50]. You have initial power = 100 and initial score = 0. We can follow the following steps to maximize the score:\n\n    Apply operation 1 on the first box with power = 50.
