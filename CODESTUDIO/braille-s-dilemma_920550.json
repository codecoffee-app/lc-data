A binary string only contains &#39;0&#39;s and &#39;1&#39;s. The strings are numbered from 1 to N and all are distinct strings.  Abhishek can only differentiate between these strings by touching them. In one touch Abhishek can identify one character at a position of any particular string from the set. Your task is to find the minimum number of touches  Abhishek has to make so that he finds that all strings are different.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\n\n The first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of strings given.\n\n From the second line onwards the next line \u2018N\u2019 lines of the test case contains distinct strings.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Return an integer denoting the minimum number of touches Abhishek has to make to distinguish between all given \u2018N\u2019 strings.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Abhishek will identify 1 for 1st string and 0 for the third string. In this way, Abhishek will distinguish 1st and 3rd strings.\nThus the total number of touches Abhishek make is 5.\n\nFor the second test case :\nThere are two strings.\nAbhishek will touch the first character of the first and second string.
