The prison&#39;s gate consists of horizontal and vertical bars that are spaced one unit apart, so the area of each hole between the bars is (1 * 1). Ninja manages to remove certain bars and make some of these holes bigger. Your task is to determine the area of the largest hole in the gate after the bars are removed.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-let-us-consider-that-the-initial-prison-gate-with-n-8-horizontal-and-m-8-vertical-bars-where-the-area-of-the-biggest-hole-in-the-bars-is-1-1-if-we-remove-the-4th-horizontal-bar-and-6th-vertical-bar-then-our-maximum-area-will-be-2-2\">For example, let us consider that the initial prison gate with \u2018n\u2019 = 8 horizontal and \u2018m\u2019 = 8 vertical bars, where the area of the biggest hole in the bars is (1 * 1). If we remove the 4th horizontal bar and 6th vertical bar, then our maximum area will be (2 * 2).</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single-space separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 denoting the number of horizontal and vertical bars respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018X\u2019 denoting the number of horizontal bars that can be removed.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains \u2018X\u2019 space-separated integers in an array \u2018H\u2019 denoting the index of horizontal bars that can be removed.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018Y\u2019 denoting the number of vertical bars that can be removed.\n\nThe fifth line of each test case contains \u2018Y\u2019 space-separated integers in an array \u2018V\u2019 denoting the index of vertical bars that can be removed.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each case, we need to return the area of the largest hole in the gate after the bars are removed.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to input or print anything, and it has already been taken care of.
