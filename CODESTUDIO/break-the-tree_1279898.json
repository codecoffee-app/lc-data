You have to break this tree into two parts by removing exactly one edge. You also have to maximise the product of the sum of the integers associated with each node in both parts.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/break-the-tree-8473.png\" alt=\"Example\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the above example, if we break the tree by removing the edge between nodes that has integers 5 and 6 then we get the maximum product of the sum of integers on nodes i.e. ( (6 + 4 + 1) * (5 + 1 + 3 + 2) ) = 121.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The answer may be very large so, you have to take the modulo with 10^9 + 7.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases are as follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains elements of the tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/btree-5038.png\" alt=\"Example\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space.
