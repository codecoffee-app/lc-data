The name of all websites is in the form of a string and all of them have a length equal to M. Ayush is searching for his favourite website but unfortunately, he forgot some of the characters of the website so he replaced those characters with \u2018?\u2019. Your task is to calculate the number of websites that can possibly be a favourite of Ayush.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>There are three websites in Ninjanet that are: &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;aba&quot; and &quot;aac&quot;.\n\nIf Ayush searches for \u201cab?\u201d then there will be 2 websites that could be a favourite of Ayush, which are &quot;abc&quot; and &quot;aba&quot;.\n\nIf Ayush searches for \u201c?a?\u201d then there will be only 1 website that could be a favourite of Ayush, i.e. &quot;aac&quot;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q, denoting the number of websites, length of each website and number of queries respectively.\n\nNext, the N line contains a single string,  where the ith line consists of the name of the ith website in the Ninjanet.\n\nNext, the Q line contains a query string, the name of the favourite website of Ayush with certain \u2018?\u2019 characters (Possibly 0), as described in the problem statement.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each query, print a single integer on a newline, denoting the number of websites that can possibly be Ayush\u2019s favourite website.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraint\">Constraint :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^4\n1 &lt;= M &lt;= 6\n1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 10^5\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5 3 5\ncat\nmap\ncam\neat\nfat\n?at\nca?\n?a?\n??t\n???\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n2\n5\n3\n5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first query, there are 3 possible favourite websites that are \u201ccat\u201d , \u201ceat\u201d and \u201cfat\u201d.\nFor the second query , there are 2 possible favourite websites that are \u201ccat\u201d , \u201ccam\u201d.\nFor the third query , all the websites have \u2018a\u2019 at their 2nd place so all are possible favourites.\nFor the fourth query , there are 3 possible favorite websites that are  \u201ccat\u201d , \u201ceat\u201d and \u201cfat\u201d.\nFor the fifth query , all the websites can be possible favourites.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3 3 2\nabc\naac\naba\nab?\n?a?\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1\n</code></pre>\n",
