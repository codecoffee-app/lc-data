Now, a balloon can only be destroyed if the player shoots its head. So, to do the needful, he/ she shoots an arrow from the left to the right side of the platform, from an arbitrary height he/she chooses. The arrow moves from left to right, at a chosen height ARR[i] until it finds a balloon. The moment when an arrow touches a balloon, the balloon gets destroyed and disappears and the arrow continues its way from left to right at a height decreased by 1. Therefore, if the arrow was moving at height ARR[i], after destroying the balloon it travels at height ARR[i]-1. The player wins this game if he destroys all the balloons in minimum arrows.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-return-the-minimum-arrows-required-to-complete-the-task\">You have to return the minimum arrows required to complete the task.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer N representing the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of input contains N space-separated integers representing the height of the balloons.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Return a single integer i.e. the count of the minimum number of arrows required to complete the task.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the output, it has already been taken care of.
