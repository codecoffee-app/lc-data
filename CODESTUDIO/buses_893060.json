The bus stops only at stops whose number is a multiple of the bus stop number from which the bus originates. You need to find the number of buses originating from each bus stop from 1 to &#39;N&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If &#39;N&#39; = 4 and the given vector is: [1 3 4 3].\n\n1 bus can be boarded from the first bus stop which means that 1 bus originates from the first bus stop.\n\n3 buses can be boarded from the second bus stop which means that (3 - 1 = 2) buses originate from the second bus stop. This is because the bus originating from the first stop will stop at the second stop as well.\n\n4 buses can be boarded from the third bus stop which means that (4-1 = 3) buses originate from the third bus stop. This is because the bus originating from the first stop will stop at the third stop as well.\n\n3 buses can be boarded from the fourth bus stop which means that (3-3 = 0) buses originate from the fourth bus stop. This is because the buses originating from the first and second stop will stop at the fourth stop as well.\n\nSo the final vector would be: [1 2 3 0].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The given vector uses 1-based indexing.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. \nThen the &#39;T&#39; test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer &#39;N&#39; representing the length of the vector.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of the given vector.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print &#39;N&#39; integers denoting the number of buses originating from each bus stop from 1 to &#39;N&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of.

This is because the bus originating from the first stop will stop at the second stop as well.\n3 buses can be boarded from the third bus stop which means that (3-1 = 2) buses originate from the third bus stop. This is because the bus originating from the first stop will stop at the third stop as well.\n4 buses can be boarded from the fourth bus stop which means that (4-1-1 = 1) buses originate from the fourth bus stop. This is because the buses originating from the first and second stop will stop at the fourth stop as well.\n5 buses can be boarded from the fifth bus stop which means that (5-1 = 4) buses originate from the fifth bus stop. This is because the bus originating from the first stop will stop at the fifth stop as well.\nSo the final vector would be: [1 1 2 2 4]\n\nFor the third test case, the given vector is: [4 4 4].\n4 buses can be boarded from the first bus stop which means that 4 buses originate from the first bus stop.\n4 buses can be boarded from the second bus stop which means that (4-4 = 0) buses originate from the second bus stop.
