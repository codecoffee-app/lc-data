After attending the course, the ninja gains some experience \u2018EXP[i]\u2019 (for the day \u2018i\u2019). On some days, the ninja is busy and will not be able to attend the course, hence not gaining any experience on that day. If \u2018BUSY[i] = 1\u2019, then the ninja is busy on day \u2018i\u2019. Otherwise, if \u2018BUSY[i] = 0\u2019, the ninja attends the course on day \u2018i\u2019. To get the most out of the course, the ninja can focus for \u2018K\u2019 days straight (only once during the course), attending the course every day for these \u2018K\u2019 consecutive days. You are given two arrays, \u2018EXP\u2019 and \u2018BUSY\u2019, each of size \u2018N\u2019. You are also given an integer \u2018K\u2019. The task is to find the maximum experience that the ninja can gain from this course.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018N\u2019 = 6, \u2018K\u2019 = 3\n\u2018EXP\u2019 = [1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 6]\n\u2018BUSY\u2019 = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nTo get the maximum experience ninja has to focus on the last \u20183\u2019 days. The maximum experience gained will be = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.
