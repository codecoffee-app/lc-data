Total cost is 1*3 + 2*3 + 3*2 = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15, You can buy 4 stocks at the 2 price i.e., buying stocks at the fourth price is possible here with available money. Cost is 15 + 4*2= 23. You can also buy 5 stocks for third day at price 3. Total cost= 23 + 5*3 = 38, which is more than our budget, Thus you can buy only 3 stocks at the fourth day price. So, we have 1+2+3 + 4= 10 stocks.
