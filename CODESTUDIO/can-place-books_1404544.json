The slots of the almirah are given in the form of an array: 0 means the slot is empty and 1 means the slot is already filled with a book. Print 1 if you can keep all the books under the given condition and 0 otherwise.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\n\nThe first line contains two integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, which denotes the number of slots and the number of books that you bought from the market.\n\nThe second line contains &#39;N&#39; integers denoting the elements of the array \u2018ARR\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print 1 if all \u2018K\u2019 books can be kept under the given condition. 0 otherwise.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

One of the possible combinations is that you can keep book 1 at index 0, book 2 at index 2. So, 1 is the answer.\n\nIn the second test case, there are 7 slots in the almirah and you have bought 2 books from the market. But the slots which are empty already have books adjacent to them. You can\u2019t keep any book in the almirah.
