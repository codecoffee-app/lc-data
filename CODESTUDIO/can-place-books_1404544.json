One of the possible combinations is that you can keep book 1 at index 0, book 2 at index 2. So, 1 is the answer.\n\nIn the second test case, there are 7 slots in the almirah and you have bought 2 books from the market. But the slots which are empty already have books adjacent to them. You can\u2019t keep any book in the almirah.
