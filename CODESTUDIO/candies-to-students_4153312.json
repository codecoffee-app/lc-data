You want each student to have a minimum of 1 candy. If two students are sitting next to each other, the one with higher marks should get more candies. Find the minimum number of candies required to distribute to all students.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given \u2018MARKS\u2019 = [7, 10, 9, 5], Here you can distribute candies as [1, 3, 2, 1]. Here all the students with higher marks than the students sitting beside them also have more candies. Hence the answer is 7.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first input line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the number of students.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers, representing the marks of each student.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Print a single integer for each test, representing the minimum number of candies required to distribute to all students.\n\nPrint a separate line for each test case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10000\n0 \u2264 MARKS[i] \u2264 10^5\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

Here all the students with higher marks than the students sitting beside them also have more candies. Hence the answer is 7.\n\nFor the second test case, \u2018MARKS\u2019 = [10, 10, 10], Here all the students have equal marks hence they can be given an equal number of candies, so we will distribute the candies as [1, 1, 1].
