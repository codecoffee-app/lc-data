Initially, the height of all the candles is 0. There are \u2018Q\u2019 queries given to Ninja. In each query, Ninja has two integers, \u2018L\u2019, and \u2018R\u2019, and Ninja should increase the height for each candle by 1 from \u2018L\u2019 to \u2018R\u2019 both inclusive. Ninja can only perform \u2018Q\u2019 - 1 queries out of \u2018Q\u2019 given queries. Find the maximum count of candles having height \u2018K\u2019 after performing \u2018Q\u2019 - 1 queries.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let \u2018N\u2019 be: 2\nLet queries be: [[1, 2], [1, 1]]\nLet \u2018K\u2019 be: 1\nInitial heights: [0, 0]\nRemoving query 1 and increasing heights in the range [1, 1] gives: [1, 0].
