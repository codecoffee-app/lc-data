If no distribution fulfills both given conditions, report it.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018N\u2019 = 5, \u2018A\u2019 = [3, 3, 2, 5, 1]\nIf we distribute candies in the following manner [4, 3, 2, 5, 1],\nEach friend will be happy as they have at least received \u2018A[i]\u2019 candies, and no two friends got the same number of candies.\nHence, the answer is (4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 1) = 15. It\u2019s guaranteed that this is the minimum number of candies required.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer, \u2018N&#39;.\nThe second line of each test case contains N single space-separated integers, representing array \u2018A\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the minimum number of candies required such that distribution follows both given conditions or return -1 if there is no such distribution.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
