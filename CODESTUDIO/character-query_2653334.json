List \u2018ARR\u2019 consists of \u2018N\u2019 lowercase letters indexed from 1 to \u2018N\u2019 . Ninja had tried to memorize the position of these letters. To test the memorizing skills of Ninja, his friend will ask \u2018Q\u2019 questions of either of the type:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1.  L ch K: Tell the largest index IDX for which there are exactly  K repetitions of character ch between indices 1 to IDX.\n2.
