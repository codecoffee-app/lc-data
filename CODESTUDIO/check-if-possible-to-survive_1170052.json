The first day of the week is Monday. You can buy \u2018n\u2019 units of food from a day\u2019s work. Now each day, you need \u2018x\u2019 units of food to survive. You are making a boat to escape the island, which will require \u2018d\u2019 days to be made. You need to survive at least \u2018d\u2019 days on the island. You are given three integers n, x, and d. Your task is to determine if you can escape the island</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run.
