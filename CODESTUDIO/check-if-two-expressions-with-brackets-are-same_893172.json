You need to compare and tell if they are similar or different. You need to return \u201cYES\u201d for the same expressions and \u201cNO\u201d for different expressions. The expressions consist of lowercase alphabets, \u2018+\u2019, \u2018-\u2019 and \u2018(\u2018, \u2018)\u2019.

So the answer is \u201cYES\u201d.\n\nIn the third test case, the first expression is: (a-b) and the second expression is: -(a-b).
