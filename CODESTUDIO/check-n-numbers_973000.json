Similarly for positions of j, k and l are set as 0 0 0 respectively.\nSo the number generated is 1 0 0 0 i.e. 8. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.    \n\nThen \u2018T\u2019 test cases follows:\n\nFirst line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the size of the input array \u2018arr\u2019. \n\nNext line contains \u2018N\u2019 space separated integers denoting the elements in the \u2018arr\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Output of each test case an integer as per the condition. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 3\n1 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 5 * (10 ^ 3)\n\nTime Limit: 1sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n8 4 2\n3\n8 8 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n8\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-test-case-1\">Explanation for Sample Test Case 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 1 :\nNumbers can be represented in bits as:\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\ni j k l\nNumber of set bits for ith index is 1. Number of unset bits for ith index is 2. Therefore the number of unset bits for ith index is greater than the number of set bits for ith index. So ith bit for the number will be 0.\n\nSimilarly for jth, kth and lth bit will be 0. As the number of unset bits is greater than the number of set bits. Answer will be 0 0 0 0 which represents number 0.\n\nTest Case 2:\nNumbers can be represented in bits as\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\ni j k l\n\nNumber of set bits for ith index is 2. Number of unset bits for ith index is 1. Therefore the number of set bits for ith index is greater than the number of unset bits for ith index. So ith bit for the number will be 1.\n\nSimilarly for jth, kth and lth bit will be 0. As the number of unset bits is greater than the number of set bits. Answer will be 1 0 0 0 which represents the number 8.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n4\n6 7 8 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n0\n</code></pre>\n",
