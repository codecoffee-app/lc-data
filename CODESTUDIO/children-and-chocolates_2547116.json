Their roll numbers are assigned from 1 to \u2018N\u2019. There is a shop along the path to home from which they buy chocolates. You are given an array \u2018CHOCOLATES\u2019, representing the number of chocolates \u2018ith\u2019 child wants but the shop only has \u2018C\u2019 chocolates. Children can only take chocolate from that shop if the following two conditions are satisfied:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. The student must be able to take all the chocolates that they want to take.\n\n2.
