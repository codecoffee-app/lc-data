One of the possible ways of doing this is to cut horizontally, which will divide our bar into 2 bars of size 1x2 each. The side length is two due to which we have to add 4 ( 2^2 = 4) to our cost, then we discard one bar and further make a vertical cut on another bar. This time the side length we cut is 1, so our cost will become 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5). Finally, we have 2 bars of 1-1 pieces each; we keep one piece and discard the other.\n\nIn the second query, we have a chocolate bar of size 2x2, and we want to take out exactly four chocolate pieces. As this whole bar contains exactly four pieces of chocolate, hence we don\u2019t have to make any cuts, and the cost will remain 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 4 5\n6 4 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>14\n25\n</code></pre>\n",
