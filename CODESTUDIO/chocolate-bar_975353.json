One of the possible ways of doing this is to cut horizontally, which will divide our bar into 2 bars of size 1x2 each. The side length is two due to which we have to add 4 ( 2^2 = 4) to our cost, then we discard one bar and further make a vertical cut on another bar. This time the side length we cut is 1, so our cost will become 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5). Finally, we have 2 bars of 1-1 pieces each; we keep one piece and discard the other.\n\nIn the second query, we have a chocolate bar of size 2x2, and we want to take out exactly four chocolate pieces. As this whole bar contains exactly four pieces of chocolate, hence we don\u2019t have to make any cuts, and the cost will remain 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 4 5\n6 4 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>14\n25\n</code></pre>\n",

                        "explanation": "Query 1:  For a 3x4 bar wanting 5 pieces, one optimal solution involves a vertical cut giving cost 3^2=9 and a horizontal cut on one section to remove 1 piece i.e. cutting the 3x1 section, giving 1^2=1 cost. For the remaining 3x3 piece you will still need one more piece, hence cutting the 3x3 piece horizontally so that the final number of pieces = 5 and a cutting cost of 3^2=9 and 1^2=1 respectively gives a total cost = 14\nQuery 2: For a 6x4 bar wanting 9 pieces, one optimal solution involves making a horizontal cut to form bars of size 2x4 and 4x4 which results in 4^2 = 16 and cutting 4x4 into two of 2x4 each results into another 16 total 32 but that leaves the pieces into 8+8=16 which is not what we want (9 pieces). If we cut horizontally to form bars of sizes 3x4 and 3x4 results in pieces equal to 12+12=24 which leaves us far from what we want, hence we need to form bars of 4x4 and 2x4, forming 16 by cutting the 6x4 with cost = 16 where we need to form two bars of sizes 4x4 and 2x4 (16 pieces + 8 pieces), hence we just need to make one more cut and it will come out as 4^2+3^2 = 16+9 giving 25."
