Each chocolate in \u2018PACKET\u2019 has a non-negative sweetness level that denotes how sweet the chocolate is. He wants to give these chocolates to his friend such that the absolute difference between chocolate with maximum sweetness and minimum sweetness should be as minimum as possible.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-order-to-do-this-ninja-uses-a-magic-number-k-under-the-following-conditions\">In order to do this, Ninja uses a magic number, &#39;K&#39; under the following conditions:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. Using this magical number, Ninja can either increase or decrease the sweetness of each chocolate. \n2. After increasing or decreasing the sweetness, all the new sweetness values must be non-negative. \n3. Ninja must use this magic number on each chocolate exactly once.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For \u2018PACKETS\u2019 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and &#39;K&#39; =  1, the absolute difference between two chocolates with maximum (5) and minimum (1) sweetness is 4. Now in order to minimize this value, Ninja increases [1, 2, 3] and decreases [4, 5] by 1 (\u2018K\u2019 = 1). So, \u2018PACKET\u2019 becomes [2,3,4,3,4]. Now, the absolute difference between the two chocolates with maximum (4) and minimum (2) sweetness is 2 which is the minimum possible. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"as-ninja-is-busy-preparing-for-the-party-he-asks-you-for-help-can-you-help-ninja-determine-the-minimum-possible-difference-between-the-maximum-and-minimum-sweetness-of-chocolates-in-packet-after-using-the-magic-number-k\">As Ninja is busy preparing for the party, he asks you for help.

We get [11,12] after modifying the \u2018PACKET\u2019.
