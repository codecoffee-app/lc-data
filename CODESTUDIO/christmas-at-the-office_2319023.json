Jim always gives Pam the best Christmas gifts. But this time, Pam decided to give Jim a string having at most two different characters. Pam has a ternary string \u2018s\u2019. She wants to know how many total numbers of contiguous strings she can make from \u2018s\u2019 to gift Jim.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-ternary-string-is-a-string-that-does-not-have-more-than-three-different-characters\">A ternary string is a string that does not have more than three different characters.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let s = \u201cabbc\u201d\n\nNow In this example, Pam can make the following substrings: \na, b, b, c, ab, bb, bc, abb, bbc.\nThere are a total of 9 strings that she can gift Jim. Hence the answer is 9.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string \u2018s\u2019 denoting the ternary string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer \u201canswer\u201d, denoting the total number of strings she can make from the given string satisfying the given conditions.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
