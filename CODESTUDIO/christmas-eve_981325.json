Since Radhika doesn&#39;t like to cook, she wants to order these dishes from restaurants.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"unfortunately-all-dishes-are-prepared-in-different-restaurants-and-therefore-radhika-needs-to-pick-up-her-orders-from-n-different-places-to-speed-up-this-process-she-wants-to-order-courier-delivery-at-some-restaurants-thus-for-each-dish-there-are-two-options-for-radhika-how-she-can-get-it\">Unfortunately, all dishes are prepared in different restaurants and therefore Radhika needs to pick up her orders from N different places. To speed up this process, she wants to order courier delivery at some restaurants. Thus, for each dish, there are two options for Radhika how she can get it:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1) The dish will be delivered by a courier from the restaurant \u2018i\u2019, in this case, the courier will arrive in A[i] minutes,\n\n2) Radhika goes to the restaurant \u2018i\u2019 on her own and picks up the dish, she will spend B[i] minutes on this.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"each-restaurant-has-its-own-couriers-and-they-start-delivering-the-order-at-the-moment-radhika-leaves-the-house-in-other-words-all-couriers-work-in-parallel-radhika-must-visit-all-restaurants-in-which-she-has-not-chosen-delivery-she-does-this-consistently\">Each restaurant has its own couriers and they start delivering the order at the moment Radhika leaves the house.
