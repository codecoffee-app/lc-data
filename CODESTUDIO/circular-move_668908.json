You are given a sequence of moves for the robot in the form of a string of size &#39;N&#39;. You are required to find whether the path followed by the robot upon taking the moves is circular or not.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-sequence-of-moves-is-circular-if-and-only-if-the-robot-ends-up-from-where-it-initially-started\">A sequence of moves is circular if and only if the robot ends up from where it initially started.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-sequence-of-moves-contains-only-three-types-of-moves\">The sequence of moves contains only three types of moves.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>&#39;G&#39;: it means that the robot will move 1 unit in the direction it is facing.\n\n&#39;L&#39;: it means that the robot will move 90 degrees towards its left. For example, if the robot is facing north and it has to make an \u2018L\u2019 move, then it will start facing the west direction.\n\n&#39;R&#39;: it means the robot will move 90 degrees towards its right. For example, if the robot is facing north and it has to make an \u2018R\u2019 move then it will start facing the east direction.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases/queries to be run. \nThen the test cases follow. \n\nThe first and the only line of input for each test case/query contains a string representing the sequence of moves.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The sequence of moves will always be:\n1.

The new position of the robot is (0,1). Now the next move is \u2018R\u2019 so it starts facing towards the east. The next move is again \u2018R\u2019 so it starts facing towards the south. The next move is \u2018G\u2019 so it moves 1 unit towards the south, therefore, the new position of the robot is (0,0). The start position and the end position of the robot are the same hence the sequence of the moves is circular.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\nGRG\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>False\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-the-sample-input-2\">Explanation of the Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, the Robot is standing at (0,0) and facing the north direction now the first move is \u2018G\u2019 so it moves one direction towards the north.

The next move is \u2018G\u2019 so it moves one direction in the east direction and its new position is (1,1). After all the moves, the robot has not reached the same place from where it started and hence the path is not circular.\n</code></pre>\n",
