The city can be imagined as a rectangular area on an X-Y plane having its left uppermost point at \u2018(0, B/2)\u2019 and right lowermost point at \u2018(L, -B/2)\u2019 (Check the image below for a better understanding).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-in-the-current-blueprint-of-the-city-there-are-n-street-lights-they-lie-on-the-ox-axis-if-imagined-in-the-x-y-plane-whose-position-is-given-by-the-pos-array-all-the-street-lights-are-at-a-distinct-position-and-each-street-light-has-a-radius-of-r-i-up-to-which-it-can-illuminate-the-city-from-pos-i\">Now in the current blueprint of the city there are \u2018N\u2019 street lights. They lie on the OX Axis if imagined in the X-Y plane whose position is given by the \u2018POS\u2019 array, all the street lights are at a distinct position.
