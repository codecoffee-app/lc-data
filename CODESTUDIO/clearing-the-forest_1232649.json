A grand festive event is going  to be organised in the city. To make place for the event, King has ordered Ninja to clear the nearby forest. The forest can be represented in the form of \u2018N\u2019*\u2018M\u2019 grid  \u2018FOREST\u2019, where each cell of \u2018FOREST\u2019 can have one of the possible values:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>0 -&gt; The cell is empty and Ninja can pass through it.\n\u2018X\u2019  -&gt; The cell contains a tree with a height equal to \u2018X\u2019 where  \u2018X\u2019 &gt; 0 and Ninja can pass through it.\n-1 -&gt; The cell can not be visited by Ninja.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-is-present-at-the-top-left-corner-of-forest-i-e-at-cell-0-0-and-he-has-to-cut-down-all-the-trees-in-forest-in-one-step-ninja-can-move-to-any-one-of-the-four-directions-east-west-north-south\">Ninja is present at the top left corner of \u2018FOREST\u2019 i.e. at cell(0,0) and he has to cut down all the trees in \u2018FOREST\u2019.
