To achieve this, you are going to perform some operations, where each operation can be one of the following types:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1.

After a total of three operations, the box contains 3 balls.\n\nFor Case 2:\nFirst operation is resetting the counter from 0 to 1. Second operation is throwing 1 ball. Third operation is resetting the counter to 2 and for next two consecutive operations, throw 2 balls in each operation. After a total of five operations, the box contains 6 balls.\nThere exists another order for operations as well, but the number of operations cannot be less than 5. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n1\n10\n9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n7\n6\n</code></pre>\n",
