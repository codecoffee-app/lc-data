On each round, you can traverse through the array \u2018ARR\u2019 from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible in increasing order. You are given \u2018M\u2019 operations in a 2-dimensional array \u2018Queries\u2019, in which Queries[i] contains two positions of the array \u2018ARR\u2019, whose values need to be swapped. The operations are performed one by one in the given order. Your task is to find the total number of rounds required to collect all the numbers from 1 to \u2018N\u2019 in increasing order after each operation.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Consider ARR = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and Queries=[[2, 3]], in the first operation, we will swap numbers at positions 2 and 3, then the array will be [4, 1, 5, 2, 3]. We will collect 1, 2, and 3 in the first round, and the array after the first round will be [4, 5]. Finally, we will collect 4 and 5 in the second round.
