All the three arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find all such elements which are present in all the three given arrays.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. The output array should have the same ordering of elements as the original arrays.\n2. Even if a particular element appears more than once in each of the three arrays, it should still be present only once in the output array.\n3. If there are no common elements in the arrays, return an empty array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the three arrays A = [ 2, 3, 4, 7 ] , B = [ 0, 0, 3, 5 ] , C = [ 1, 3, 8, 9 ]\nThe output array should be [ 3 ] as 3 is the only element which is present in all the three arrays.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers &#39;N&#39;, &#39;M&#39; and &#39;K&#39; denoting the number of elements in Array A, Array B and Array C respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array &#39;A&#39;.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains &#39;M&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array &#39;B&#39;.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains &#39;K&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array &#39;C&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of output of each test case should contain the elements that are common in all three arrays separated by space.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a new line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N, M, K &lt;= 30000\n0 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10^9\n0 &lt;= B[i] &lt;= 10^9\n0 &lt;= C[i] &lt;= 10^9\n\nWhere &#39;A[i]&#39;, &#39;B[i]&#39;, &#39;C[i]&#39; denotes the &#39;i&#39;th&#39; element of the arrays &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; respectively.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 3 3\n1 4 5 6\n3 4 5 \n5 6 7\n3 1 3\n4 6 8\n6\n2 2 6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>5\n6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for Sample Input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case : \nElements that are common in array A and B = [ 4, 5 ]. Out of which only 5 is present in Array C. Therefore the output array is [ 5 ] in this case.\n\nFor the second test case : \nIt can be seen that only 6 is present in all the three arrays.
