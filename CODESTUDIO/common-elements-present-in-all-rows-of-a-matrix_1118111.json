Your task is to find all elements which are present in each row of the matrix.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The output array can contain the elements in any particular order.\n\n2. Even if a particular element appears more than once in each matrix row, it should still be present only once in the output array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the matrix MAT [ [ 2, 3, 4, 7 ] , [ 0, 0, 3, 5 ] , [ 1, 3, 8, 9 ] ] having 3 rows and 4 columns respectively.\nThe output array should be [ 3 ] as 3 is the only element that is present in all three rows.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, &#39;N&#39; and &#39;M&#39;, denoting the number of rows and columns in the Matrix &#39;MAT&#39;, respectively.\n\nEach of the next &#39;N&#39; lines contains &#39;M&#39; space-separated integers denoting the matrix &#39;MAT&#39; elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of output of each test case should contain all elements which are present in each row of the given matrix separated by a single space.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a new line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N, M &lt;= 1000\n0 &lt;= MAT[i][j] &lt;= 10^9\n\nWhere &#39;MAT[i][j]&#39; denotes the element present at the &#39;i-th&#39; row and the &#39;j-th&#39; column of the matrix &#39;MAT&#39;.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 4\n1 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6\n5 6 7 2\n3 2\n4 6 \n6 4\n2 6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5 6\n6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case : \nElements that are common in the first two rows are 4, 5, and 6. Out of which only 5 and 6 are present in the third row. Therefore the output array is [ 5, 6 ] in this case.\n\nFor the second test case : \nWe can see that only 6 are present in all three rows. Therefore the output array is [ 6 ] in this case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 3\n1 2 3\n2 2 3\n2 3 1\n2 3 4\n3 3\n1 2 3\n0 6 0\n4 6 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2 3 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-2\">Explanation for Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case : \nAs elements 2 and 3 are present in all three rows of the matrix. Therefore the output array is [ 2, 3 ] in this case.\n\nFor the second test case : \nThere is no such element that is present in all three rows. Therefore the output array is an empty array in this case.\n</code></pre>\n",
