For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If a string has &#39;x&#39; repeated 5 times, replace this &quot;xxxxx&quot; with &quot;x5&quot;.\nThe string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal to 9. You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function and return the compressed string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The output contains the string after compression printed in single line\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^6\n\nWhere &#39;N&#39; is the length of the input string.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>aaabbccdsa\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>a3b2c2dsa\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the given string &#39;a&#39; is repeated 3 times, &#39;b&#39; is repeated 2 times, &#39;c&#39; is repeated 2 times and &#39;d&#39;, &#39;s&#39; and &#39;a&#39; and occuring 1 time hence no compression for last 3 characters.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>aaabbcddeeeee\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>a3b2cd2e5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-2\">Explanation for Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the given string &#39;a&#39; is repeated 3 times, &#39;b&#39; is repeated 2 times, &#39;c&#39; is occuring single time, &#39;d&#39; is repeating 2 times and &#39;e&#39; is repeating 5times.\n</code></pre>\n",
