Ninja is very excited to join the team, but Tony put him in trouble by asking him to decode a secret code corresponding to an integer, which is the criteria for joining the team.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"tony-gave-him-a-number-n-for-which-the-secret-code-will-be-the-decimal-value-of-the-binary-string-formed-by-concatenating-the-binary-representations-of-1-to-n-in-order-ninja-desperately-wants-to-join-the-team-so-he-needs-your-help-to-find-the-secret-code\">Tony gave him a number \u2018N\u2019 for which the secret code will be the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of 1 to \u2018N\u2019 in order. Ninja desperately wants to join the team, so he needs your help to find the secret code.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Given N = 3. The binary representation of 1, 2, and 3 are 1, 10, and 11, respectively. So, the string formed by concatenating the binary representation of 1, 2, and 3 is \u201c11011\u201d, whose decimal value is 27. Therefore, the secret code corresponding to N = 3 is 27.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 to be decoded.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of 1 to \u2018N\u2019 in order. Since the decimal value can be very large, print the answer after modulo 1000000007.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 3000\n\nWhere \u2018T\u2019 is the number of test cases and \u2018N\u2019 is the integer to be decoded.\n\nTime limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5\n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1765\n6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-of-sample-output-1\">Explanation of Sample Output 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 1 :  \nGiven N = 5.\nThe binary representation of 1 is 1.\nThe binary representation of 2 is 10.\nThe binary representation of 3 is 11.\nThe binary representation of 4 is 100.\nThe binary representation of 5 is 101.\nAfter concatenating, string = \u201c11011100101\u201d, whose decimal value is 1765.\nTherefore, the secret code corresponding to N = 5 is 1765, which is printed as output.\n\nTest Case 2 :\nGiven N = 2.\nThe binary representation of 1 is 1.\nThe binary representation of 2 is 10.\nAfter concatenating, string = \u201c110\u201d whose decimal value is 6.\nTherefore, the secret code corresponding to N = 2 is 6, which is printed as output.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1\n40\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1\n603205042\n</code></pre>\n",
