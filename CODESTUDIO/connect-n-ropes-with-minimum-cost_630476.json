For example, if we connect 4 and 6 first (we get three ropes of lengths 3, 2 and 10), then connect 10 and 3 (we get two ropes of length 13 and 2). Finally we connect 13 and 2. Total cost in this way is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38 which is not the optimal cost\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>5\n1 2 3 4 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>33\n</code></pre>\n",
