There are \u2018N\u2019 kingdoms, kingdoms are numbered from 0 to &#39;N&#39; - 1 and form of a <strong>tree</strong>, you are also given the information about the edges of this tree depicting all the Kingdoms that are adjacent to each other.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-ruler-with-the-most-kingdoms-is-considered-the-most-powerful-you-desire-to-become-the-greatest-ruler-without-having-to-fight-with-aragorn-kingdoms-are-conquered-one-at-a-time-in-turns-in-order-to-make-the-process-smooth-and-less-violent\">The ruler with the most kingdoms is considered the most powerful. You desire to become the greatest ruler without having to fight with Aragorn. Kingdoms are conquered one at a time in turns in order to make the process smooth and less violent.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"aragorn-initially-rules-only-the-xth-kingdom-and-all-other-kingdoms-are-not-ruled-by-anyone-in-each-turn-a-ruler-can-conquer-another-kingdom-that-is-adjacent-to-one-of-his-current-kingdoms-and-is-ruled-by-none-of-the-rulers-the-opponent-plays-the-next-turn-and-the-process-is-repeated-the-game-continues-until-both-the-players-run-out-of-moves-if-a-ruler-has-no-available-adjacent-kingdom-to-conquer-then-he-passes-his-turn-in-the-end-the-ruler-with-more-kingdoms-under-his-control-wins-the-game\">Aragorn initially rules only the \u2018X<sup>th</sup>\u2019 kingdom and all other kingdoms are not ruled by anyone. In each turn, a ruler can conquer another kingdom that is adjacent to one of his current kingdoms and is ruled by none of the rulers, the opponent plays the next turn and the process is repeated. The game continues until both the players run out of moves. If a ruler has no available adjacent kingdom to conquer then he passes his turn. In the end, the ruler with more kingdoms under his control wins the game.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"aragorn-gives-you-an-advantage-in-the-first-turn-letting-you-choose-a-kingdom-of-your-choice-but-for-all-other-moves-you-can-only-conquer-a-kingdom-adjacent-to-one-of-your-current-kingdoms-if-aragorn-plays-optimally-determine-if-it-s-possible-for-you-to-win-by-becoming-the-most-powerful-or-not-print-true-if-you-can-become-more-powerful-than-aragorn-else-return-false\">Aragorn gives you an advantage in the first turn, letting you choose a kingdom of your choice, but for all other moves, you can only conquer a kingdom adjacent to one of your current kingdoms. If Aragorn plays optimally, determine if it\u2019s possible for you to win by becoming the most powerful or not, print \u201ctrue\u201d if you can become more powerful than Aragorn, else return \u201cfalse\u201d.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If N = 7, X = 2 and Edges = { {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {4, 6} }\n\nThen the tree is: \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/1589735154342-13515.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Here N = 7 depicts that there are seven kingdoms (numbered from 0 to 6). Edges depict that kingdom-0 and kingdom-1 are adjacent, kingdom-0 and kingdom-2 are adjacent, and so on. And Aragorn initially controls kingdom-2.\nThen in this case, if you select kingdom-1 in your first then, then Aargon will select kingdom-0 in the next turn, as both rulers play optimally, therefore in the end Aargon will be ruling kingdom-0, kingdom-2 and kingdom-3 and the remaining four kingdoms will be ruled by you. Hence you will be able to win the game and therefore we will print \u201ctrue\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \u2018N\u2019, and \u2018X\u2019 denoting the number of kingdoms and the kingdom initially ruled by Aragorn respectively.\n\nThe next N - 1 lines each contain two integers each denoting the kingdoms that are adjacent to each other.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u201ctrue\u201d if you can conquer more kingdoms than Aragorn, else print \u201cfalse\u201d.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
