You are provided with a string \u2018STR,\u2019 and your task is to find the length of the longest consecutive character path for each character in the string \u2018STR\u2019. All characters in the path are consecutive, i.e., every character in the path is next to the previous character in alphabetical order. It is allowed to move in all 8 adjacent directions from a cell.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Suppose you are at position (x, y) then you can move to : [ (x + 1 , y ), ( x - 1 , y ), ( x , y + 1), (x , y - 1), (x + 1, y + 1), (x + 1, y - 1), (x - 1, y + 1), (x - 1, y - 1) ].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If \u2018N\u2019 = 2, \u2018M\u2019 = 2, &#39;STR\u2019 = &quot;a&quot; and the input matrix is \n[ [ ab ]\n  [ ed ] ] \nWe need to find the maximum length of the path from starting character \u2019a\u2019.
