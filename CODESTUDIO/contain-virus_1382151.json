The 0\u2019s in the model represent uninfected cells and 1\u2019s represent the cells contaminated by a deadly spreading virus. Only a single wall can be built between any two cells of the model that are adjacent in all four directions, on their shared boundary.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"with-every-passing-night-the-virus-spreads-to-all-the-adjacent-cells-unless-the-cells-are-blocked-by-a-wall-you-need-to-build-walls-in-order-to-stop-the-virus-from-spreading-in-the-whole-country-note-that-you-can-only-install-walls-around-only-one-region-which-is-the-affected-area-that-threatens-to-infect-the-most-uninfected-cells-of-the-matrix-in-one-day\">With every passing night, the virus spreads to all the adjacent cells, unless the cells are blocked by a wall. You need to build walls in order to stop the virus from spreading in the whole country. Note that you can only install walls around only one region which is the affected area that threatens to infect the most uninfected cells of the matrix in one day.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-the-state-of-each-cell-your-task-is-to-find-the-number-of-walls-you-used-to-stop-as-many-cells-as-possible-from-being-infected\">Given the state of each cell, your task is to find the number of walls you used to stop as many cells as possible from being infected.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.
