Where each number of the sequence represents the height of the line drawn at point &#39;i&#39;. Hence on the cartesian plane, each line is drawn from coordinate (&#39;i&#39;,0) to coordinate (&#39;i&#39;, &#39;A[i]&#39;), here \u2018i\u2019 ranges from 1 to \u2018N\u2019. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most area of water.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. You can not slant the container i.e. the height of the water is equal to the minimum height of the two lines which define the container.\n\n2.

The area of water contained between these two lines is (height* width) = (5-2)* 9 = 27, which is the maximum area contained between any two lines present on the plane.
