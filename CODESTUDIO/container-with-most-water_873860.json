Where each number of the sequence represents the height of the line drawn at point &#39;i&#39;. Hence on the cartesian plane, each line is drawn from coordinate (&#39;i&#39;,0) to coordinate (&#39;i&#39;, &#39;A[i]&#39;), here \u2018i\u2019 ranges from 1 to \u2018N\u2019. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most area of water.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. You can not slant the container i.e. the height of the water is equal to the minimum height of the two lines which define the container.\n\n2. Do not print anything, you just need to return the area of the container with maximum water.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example</h5>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/water-5805.jpg\" alt=\"water-diagram\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>For the above Diagram, the first red marked line is formed between coordinates (2,0) and (2,10), and the second red-marked line is formed between coordinates (5,0) and (5,9). The area of water contained between these two lines is (height* width) = (5-2)* 9 = 27, which is the maximum area contained between any two lines present on the plane. So in this case, we will return 3* 9=27.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe next \u20182*T\u2019 lines represent the \u2018T\u2019 test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the number of elements in the sequence.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018n\u2019 space-separated integers which is the given sequence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case return the area of the container which can hold the maximum amount of water using any pair of lines from the given sequence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50\n0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^4\n1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10^5\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5\n4 3 2 1 4\n3\n1 2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>16\n2 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-the-sample-input-1\">Explanation of The Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first case: \nWe can create \u2018n(n+1)/2\u2019 different containers using \u2018N&#39; containers for example with 1st and 3rd line we can create a container of area = (3-1)*min(4,2)=4.\n\nAll Possible Containers:  \n\n\nLines used          Area\n4,3         area=min(4,3)*1=3\n4,2         area=min(4,2)*2=4\n4,1         area=min(4,1)*3=3\n4,4         area=min(4,4)*4=16\n3,2         area=min(3,2)*1=2\n3,1         area=min(3,1)*2=2\n3,4         area=min(3,4)*3=9\n2,1         area=min(2,1)*1=1\n2,4         area=min(2,4)*2=4\n1,4         area=min(1,4)*1=1\n\n\nBut among all such containers the one with the maximum area will be formed by using the first and last line, the area of which is : (5-1)*min(4,4)=16.\n\nHence we return 16.\n\nFor the second case: \nWe can take the first and third line to get an area of (3-1)*min(1,1)=2 which is the maximum possible area in this sequence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5\n12 4 6 8 1\n3\n1 2 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>24\n2\n</code></pre>\n",
