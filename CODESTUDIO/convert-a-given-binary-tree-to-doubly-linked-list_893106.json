Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of input contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\n\nExample :\n\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-1-6520.png\" alt=\"alt txt\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\nExplanation  :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level.
