Ankur always likes to challenge Deepa with interesting mathematical problems. For a given integer \u2018N\u2019 Ankur wants his friend Deepa to find a pair of positive integers [A, B] such that A + B == \u2018N\u2019. Since Ankur is an intelligent boy, he adds an additional constraint over \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. Both integers should not contain any 0 in their decimal representation. Please help Deepa to solve this problem.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Please assume that there is at least one valid solution.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.
