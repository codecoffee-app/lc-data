There are \u2018N\u2019 cooks in \u2018CookingNinjas\u2019 numbered from 0 to N-1.

He will prepare one dish in 2 minutes, one more dish in the next 4 mins and one more in the next 6 minutes hence in a total of 12 minutes he can make 3 dishes, Note, In 13 minutes also he can make only 3 dishes as he does not have enough time for the 4th dish).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"one-day-cookingninjas-receive-an-order-of-m-dishes-that-they-need-to-complete-as-early-as-possible-you-are-given-an-integer-array-rank-of-size-n-in-which-rank-i-gives-rank-of-ith-cook-and-an-integer-m-you-need-to-find-out-the-minimum-times-required-to-complete-this-order-of-m-dishes\">One day \u2018CookingNinjas\u2019 receive an order of \u2018M\u2019 dishes that they need to complete as early as possible.

Then the minimum time required to cook 11 dishes will be 12 minutes.  The cooks should prepare dishes in the following manner -:\nCook-0 prepare 4 dishes in 10 minutes i.e (1 dish in 1 minute, 1 more dish in next 2 minutes, 1 more dish in next 3 minutes, 1 more dish in next 4 minutes).\nCook-1 prepare 3 dishes in 12 minutes i.e (1 dish in 2 minutes, 1 more dish in 4 minutes, 1 more dish in 6 minutes).\nCook-2 prepare 2 dishes in 9 minutes i.e (1 dish in 3 minutes, 1 more dish in the next 6 minutes).\nCook-3 prepare 2 dishes in 12 minutes i.e (1 dish in 4 minutes, 1 more dish in the next 8 minutes).\nIf all four cooks work simultaneously then they can prepare(4 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11) dishes in 12 minutes.
