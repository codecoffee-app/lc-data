He found an interesting question but had no hints on how to solve it. The question statement says two numbers, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 are given, and a range \u2018X\u2019 to \u2018Y\u2019 is given. You have to copy the set bits of \u2018A\u2019 in the range \u2018X\u2019 to \u2018Y\u2019 in \u2018B\u2019 and print the modified value of \u2018B\u2019.Can you help Ninja in solving this problem?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If \u2018A\u2019 is 13(1101) and \u2018B\u2019 is 7(0111), and the range is 2 to 4. So, we will copy the set bits in the range 2 to 4 from the left. The set bits in this range are the 3rd bit and the 4th bit. So, we will copy these bits to \u2018B\u2019.Now, the modified B will be 15(1111) as we copied the 4th bit. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, and the range \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y.\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u2018an integer corresponding to the modified value of \u2018B\u2019.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of.
