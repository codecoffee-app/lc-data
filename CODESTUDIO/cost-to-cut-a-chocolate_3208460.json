The order of cuts can be changed. The cost of one cut is the length of the chocolate to be cut. Therefore, the total cost is the sum of all the cuts. Print the minimum cost to cut the chocolate.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>All the integers in the \u2018CUTS\u2019 array are distinct.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let \u2018N\u2019 be: 4\nLet the \u2018CUTS\u2019 array be: [1, 3].\n\nLet the order of doing the cut be [1, 3].\nThe first cut of 1 on length 4 results in a cost of 4, and chocolate is split into two parts of the length of 1 and 3.\nThe second cut of 3 on length 3 results in a cost of 3, and chocolate is split into two parts again of the length of 2 and 1.
