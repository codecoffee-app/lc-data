He came across a problem in which he has given a linked list of \u2018N\u2019 nodes and an array \u2018ARR\u2019 of size \u2018M\u2019 that is the subset of the values present in the linked list. He has to print the number of connected components present in the array. Two values are said to be connected if they present next to each other in the linked list.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the linked list separated by space and terminated by -1.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains an integer \u2018M\u2019, representing the size of the array \u2018ARR\u2019.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains \u2018M\u2019 space-separated integers, representing the array \u2018ARR\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the number of connected components.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
