Your task is to find the total number of distinct elements present in every \u2018K\u2019 sized window of the array. A \u2018K\u2019 sized window can also be viewed as a series of continuous \u2018K\u2019 elements present in the sequence.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The size of \u2018ARR\u2019 will always be greater than or equal to the \u2018K\u2019.\n2. Here window refers to a subarray of \u2018ARR\u2019. Hence \u2018K\u2019 sized window means a subarray of size \u2018K\u2019.\n3. You are not required to print the output explicitly. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the function and return an array of the count of all distinct elements in the \u2018K\u2019 size window.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Consider ARR = [ 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3 ] and K = 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-79-6161.png\" alt=\"subsequence\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>As per the given input, we have a sequence of numbers of length 7, and we need to find the number of distinct elements present in all the windows of size 3.\n\nWindow-1 has three elements { 1, 2, 1 } and only two elements { 1, 2 } are distinct because 1 is repeating two times.\nWindow-2 has three elements { 2, 1, 3 } and all three elements are distinct { 2, 1, 3 }.\nWindow-3 has three elements { 1, 3, 4 } and all three elements are distinct { 1, 3, 4 }.\nWindow-4 has three elements { 3, 4, 2 } and all three elements are distinct { 3, 4, 2 }.\nWindow-5 has three elements { 4, 2, 3 } and all three elements are distinct { 4, 2, 3 }.\n\nHence, the count of distinct elements in all K sized windows is { 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 }.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, &#39;N&#39; and \u2018K\u2019, denoting the number of elements in the array and the size of the window.\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array &#39;ARR&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an array that contains the number of distinct elements in all \u2018K\u2019 size windows, and the count of distinct elements must be from the left to the right window. \n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 5\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= N\n1 &lt;=ARR[i] &lt;= 10 ^ 9\n\nWhere &#39;T&#39; denotes the number of test cases, &#39;N&#39; denotes the number of elements in the array, \u2018K\u2019 denotes the size of the window, and &#39;ARR[i]&#39; denotes the &#39;i-th&#39; element of the array &#39;ARR&#39;.\n\nTime limit: 1 second\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n7 4\n1 2 1 3 4 2 3\n5 3\n1 1 2 1 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3 4 4 3\n2 2 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-1\">Explanation of sample input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 1:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-81-6162.png\" alt=\"subsequence\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Window-1 has four elements { 1, 2, 1, 3 } and only three elements { 1, 2, 3 } are distinct because 1 is repeating two times.\nWindow-2 has four elements { 2, 1, 3, 4 } and all four elements { 2, 1, 3, 4 } are distinct.\nWindow-3 has four element { 1, 3, 4, 2 } and all four elements { 1, 3, 4, 2 } are distinct. \nWindow-4 has four element { 3, 4, 2, 3 } and only three elements { 3, 4, 2 } are distinct because 3 is repeating two times.\n\nHence, the count of distinct elements in all windows is { 3, 4, 4, 3}.\n\nTest case 2: \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-83-6163.png\" alt=\"subsequence\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Window-1 has three elements { 1, 1, 2 } and only two elements { 1, 2 } are distinct because 1 is repeating two times.\nWindow-2 has three elements { 1, 2, 1 } and only two elements { 2, 1 } are distinct.\nWindow-3 has three elements { 2, 1, 3 } and all three elements { 2, 1, 3 } are distinct.\n\nHence, the count of distinct elements in all windows is { 2, 2, 3 }.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 1\n2 3 1 2\n5 2\n2 2 3 2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2\n</code></pre>\n",
