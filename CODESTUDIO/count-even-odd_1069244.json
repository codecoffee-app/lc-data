A magic number M is the summation of the count of characters that occupy even positions in English alphabets and have even frequency, and the count of characters that occupy odd positions in English alphabets and have an odd frequency.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-return-even-if-m-is-even-otherwise-return-odd\">You have to return \u201cEVEN\u201d if M is even, otherwise return \u201cODD\u201d.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If we are given a string \u2018aabb\u2019.Then we can see the frequency of a=2 and b=2. The position of \u2018a\u2019 in alphabets is 1 and the position of \u2018b\u2019 is 2. So \u2018a\u2019 has an even frequency but its position is odd, so it will not contribute to M. As \u2018b\u2019 has an even frequency and its position is also even, so M=1. Now M =1 which is odd, so we have to return \u201cODD\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases. The &#39;T&#39; test cases follow.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a string &#39;STR&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u201cEVEN\u201d if M is even, else return \u201cODD\u201d without quotes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 4\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\nabbadef\nbbbb\nxyz\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>EVEN\nODD\nODD\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for sample output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>(i) For the first string M=2 which is even.\n(ii) For the second string M=1 which is odd.\n(iii) For the third string M=1 which is odd.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\nabbc\nbbdddd\nz\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>ODD\nEVEN\nEVEN\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-2\">Explanation for sample output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>(i) For the first string M=3 which is odd.\n(ii) For the second string M=2 which is even.\n(iii) For the third string M=0 which is even.\n</code></pre>\n",
