A magic number M is the summation of the count of characters that occupy even positions in English alphabets and have even frequency, and the count of characters that occupy odd positions in English alphabets and have an odd frequency.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-return-even-if-m-is-even-otherwise-return-odd\">You have to return \u201cEVEN\u201d if M is even, otherwise return \u201cODD\u201d.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If we are given a string \u2018aabb\u2019.Then we can see the frequency of a=2 and b=2. The position of \u2018a\u2019 in alphabets is 1 and the position of \u2018b\u2019 is 2. So \u2018a\u2019 has an even frequency but its position is odd, so it will not contribute to M. As \u2018b\u2019 has an even frequency and its position is also even, so M=1. Now M =1 which is odd, so we have to return \u201cODD\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases.
