Your task is to find the total number of good subsets. A subset is called a good subset when you can rearrange the elements of the subset in such a way that each element divides the next element in order. Two subsets are different from each other if there is an element in one subset, which does not exist in the other.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Consider ARR = [2, 4, 5, 15], all possible good subsets following the given conditions are (2), (4), (5), (15), (2,4), and (5,15). Hence, the total number of good subsets is 6 in this case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.
