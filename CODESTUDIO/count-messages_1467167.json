Both 'user' and 'time' will be given as strings.\n\n**Type 2 (Message Count in Chunks):** `2 'l' 'r' 'user' 'k'` - This requires you to determine the number of messages received by user `'user'` within the time range `[l, r]`, divided into chunks of size `k`.'l', 'r' and 'k' will be given as strings. Your output should be a list representing the number of messages received by the user in each chunk.\n\nFor each Type 2 query, calculate and return a list of integers.
