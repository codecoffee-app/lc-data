He is very good at mathematics. So to test his skills, one of his friends Shyam thought of giving him a task.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-the-task-shyam-would-give-ram-a-target-array-of-n-length-and-also-give-him-an-array-arr-of-length-n-with-all-zeros-ram-has-to-change-the-array-arr-into-the-target-array-using-the-minimum-number-of-operations-the-two-types-of-operation-that-can-be-performed-on-the-array-arr-are-as-follows\">In the task, Shyam would give Ram a \u2018TARGET\u2019 array of \u2018N\u2019 length. And also give him an array \u2018ARR\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019 with all zeros. Ram has to change the array \u2018ARR\u2019 into the \u2018TARGET\u2019 array using the minimum number of operations. The two types of operation that can be performed on the array \u2018ARR\u2019 are as follows:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"1-incremental-operations-choose-1-element-from-the-array-arr-and-increment-its-value-by-one\">1) Incremental operations: Choose 1 element from the array \u2018ARR\u2019 and increment its value by one.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"2-doubling-operation-double-the-values-of-all-the-elements-of-the-array-arr\">2) Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of the array \u2018ARR\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"shyam-is-not-as-smart-as-ram-he-needs-your-assistance-to-find-the-minimum-number-of-operations-required-to-change-the-array-arr-into-target-so-that-he-can-verify-the-correctness-of-the-answer-given-by-ram-can-you-help-him-to-find-the-minimum-steps\">Shyam is not as smart as Ram, He needs your assistance to find the minimum number of operations required to change the array \u2018ARR\u2019 into \u2018TARGET\u2019. So that he can verify the correctness of the answer given by Ram.
