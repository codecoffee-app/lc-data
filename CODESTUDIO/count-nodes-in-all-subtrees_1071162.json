You need to find the total number of elements in all the subtrees of the given tree. In other words, given a generic tree, find the count of elements in the subtrees rooted at each node.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T. The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree.
