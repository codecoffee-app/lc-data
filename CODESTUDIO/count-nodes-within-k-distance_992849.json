Here nodes 1,2, and 4 are marked, and let us take the value of K as 3, i.e., we have to find all the nodes at a distance less than 3 from all the marked nodes. We can see that nodes with index 5,9,8,2,0,7 have distances less than 3 from all marked nodes; therefore, the total count of nodes will be 6.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains two space-separated integers &#39;V&#39; and &#39;E&#39;, denoting the number of vertices and edges in the graph.\n\nThe next &#39;E&#39; lines contain two space-separated integers denoting the vertices between whom edges exist.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer &#39;K&#39; denoting the distance.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer &#39;M&#39; representing the number of marked nodes in the graph.\n\nThe next line contains &#39;M&#39; space-separated integers representing marked nodes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the count of the nodes which are less than &#39;K&#39; distance from all the marked nodes.\n\nThe output of every test case will be printed in a separate line. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
