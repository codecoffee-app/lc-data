Your task is to find the total number of matches played in the tournament if the condition for the tournament is as follows:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. If the current number of teams(N) playing in the tournament is even then, a total of N / 2 matches will be played. The winning N / 2 teams will advance to the next round, and the losing N / 2 teams will be eliminated.\n\n2. If the current number of teams(N) playing in the tournament is odd then, 1 team will be advanced to the next round directly, and a total of (N - 1) / 2 matches will be played. The winning (N - 1) / 2 teams will advance to the next round, and the losing (N - 1) / 2 teams will be eliminated.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer, \u2018T,\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains one integer &#39;N&#39;, as described in the problem statement.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the total number of matches played in the tournament.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 8\n\nTime Limit: 1 second\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>8\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for sample input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first round, 8 teams will play 4 matches, and 1 team will be directly advanced to the next round. So including the winners of the first round, a total of 5 teams will advance to the next round.\n\nIn the second round, 5 teams will play 2 matches, and 1 team will directly advance to the next round. So including the winners of the second round, a total of 3 teams will advance to the next round.   \n\nIn the third round, 3 teams will play 1 match, and 1 team will directly advance to the next round. So including the winners of the third round, a total of 2 teams will advance to the next round.\n\nIn the final round, the 2 teams will play 1 match, and then there will be a winner of the tournament.\n\nTherefore the total number of matches played is 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n32\n78\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>31\n77\n</code></pre>\n",
