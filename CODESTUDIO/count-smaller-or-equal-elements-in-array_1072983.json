Let&#39;s call the first array A and the second array B. A finds the number of elements in array B that are smaller than or equal to that element for every array element.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>A = [2, 3, 0] , B = [5, 1]\n\nFor the first index, A[0] = 2\nIn array B only 1 is less than 2. Therefore the answer for the first index is 1.\n\nFor the second index, A[1] = 3\nIn array B only 1 is less than 3. Therefore the answer for the second index is also 1.\n\nFor the third index, A[2] = 0\nBoth the elements of array B are greater than 0. \nTherefore the answer for the third index is 0.\n\nHence, the final answer is [1,1,0] in this case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\nThen the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of elements in the array A. \n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the elements of array A.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains an integer \u2018M\u2019 denoting the number of elements in array B. \n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018M&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of array B.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print N space-separated integers represent the number of elements in array B that are smaller than the corresponding element in array A.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of.

Therefore the answer for the first index is 2.\n\nFor the second index, A[1] = 4\nIn array B, one element is smaller than 4 and one element is equal to 4. Therefore the answer for the second index is also 2.\n\nFor the third index, A[2] = 3\nIn array B only one element is equal to 3. Therefore the answer for the third index is 1.\n\nFor the fourth index, A[3] = 2\nBoth the elements of Array B are greater than 2. Therefore the answer for the fourth index is 0.\n\nFor the fifth index, A[4] = 1\nBoth the elements of Array B are greater than 1. Therefore the answer for the last index is 0.\n\nHence, the final answer is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0] in this case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n4\n-2 1 3 0\n4\n-1 0 2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code> 0 3 4 2\n</code></pre>\n",
