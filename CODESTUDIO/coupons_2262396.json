Your task is to pick up the coupons from the list. You can pick up coupons consecutively. To use any coupons, you have to pick the same number at least two times. Your task is to find the minimum number of coupons you have to pick to avail yourself any coupon. Return -1 if it\u2019s not possible to avail any coupons.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given,\u2019coupons\u2019 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6], here you can pick up coupons that are [3, 4, 5, 3] and avail coupon number \u20183\u2019, The total number of coupons picked up are 4.
