Each session is identified by `session_id`, and `duration` represents the time in seconds a user spent on the application. Your task is to categorize these sessions into duration bins and count the number of sessions falling into each bin. The bins are defined as follows:\n\n*   `[0-5>`: Sessions with durations between 0 seconds (inclusive) and 300 seconds (exclusive). (0-5 minutes)\n*   `[5-10>`: Sessions with durations between 300 seconds (inclusive) and 600 seconds (exclusive). (5-10 minutes)\n*   `[10-15>`: Sessions with durations between 600 seconds (inclusive) and 900 seconds (exclusive). (10-15 minutes)\n*   `15 or more`: Sessions with durations greater than or equal to 900 seconds. (15+ minutes)\n\nWrite an SQL query to report the (bin, total) for each bin, representing the number of sessions belonging to that bin. The order of the results is not important.",
