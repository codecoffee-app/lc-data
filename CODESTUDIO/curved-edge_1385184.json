But we can observe that the path that directly connects node 1 to node 3 is longer than the path that goes from node 1 to node 2 and then from node 2 to node 3. Although lengths of both the special links are smaller than their corresponding normal links, we can choose at most 1 special link. So we go from node 1 to node 2 using a normal link having a length of 3 and then from node 2 to node 3 using a special link having length 2. So, the total length of this path becomes 5 which is the least among all other possible paths.\n</code></pre>\n",
