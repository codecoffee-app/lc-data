When 3 will be added to the stream, then the disjoint intervals will be {1, 1}, {3, 3}. But when 2 is added to the stream then the disjoint interval will be {1, 3} as 2 lies between these two sets of disjoint intervals, and both the intervals {1, 1} and {3, 3} merge.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first input line contains an integer \u2018n\u2019, representing the total number of queries.\n\nThen the next \u2018n\u2019 lines contain \u2018n\u2019 queries. A query can be of two types:\n1 val \u2192 adds the integer \u2018val\u2019 to the stream.\n2 \u2192 returns a list of disjoint intervals.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print all the disjoint intervals for each query of type 2, and output the answer to the query in a single line.\n\nEach query must be answered in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

When 6 will be added to the stream, then the disjoint intervals will be {3, 3},{6, 6}. But when 5 is added to the stream, then the disjoint interval will be {3, 3}, {5, 6} as 5 merges with the interval {6, 6} because the difference between interval {5, 5} and {6, 6} is less than 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>6\n1 1\n2\n1 4\n2\n1 3\n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 1\n1 1 4 4\n1 1 3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>First, 1 is added to the stream, and the disjoint interval will be {1, 1}.
