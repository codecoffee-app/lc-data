He found that after insertion of some nodes, he was unable to insert any more nodes to a leaf node. In such a scenario he termed the BST as Dead End. He has many sets of BST, it is very difficult for him to individually find whether a BST is Dead End or not. He asked you to design an algorithm to find whether a  given  Binary Search Tree (BST) containing positive integers only is  Dead End or not.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-a-bst-is-said-to-be-dead-end-if-there-exists-a-leaf-node-in-the-bst-for-which-it-is-impossible-to-insert-any-further-nodes-after-that-node-in-that-bst-if-such-nodes-do-not-exist-then-the-bst-is-not-said-to-be-dead-end\">Note: A BST is said to be Dead End if there exists a leaf node in the BST, for which it is impossible to insert any further nodes after that node in that BST.
