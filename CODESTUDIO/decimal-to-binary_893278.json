New number is 10/2 = 5. \n3) Remainder when five is divided by 2 is 1\n4) Divide five by 2. New number is 5/2 = 2. \n5) Remainder when two is divided by 2 is zero.\n6) Divide two by 2. New number is 2/2 = 1. \n7) Remainder when one is divided by two is 1.\n8) Divide 1 by 2. New number is 1/2 = 0. \n\n Since the number becomes = 0, break out of the loop. So the final answer is the reverse of all the remainders obtained which is 1010.\n\n In the second test case, \u2018N\u2019 is 7, and we apply similar steps as given above. \n The final answer comes out to be 111.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sample Input 2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2\n12\n33\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1100   \n100001\n</code></pre>\n",
