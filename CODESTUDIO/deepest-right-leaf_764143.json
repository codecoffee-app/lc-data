Your task is to find and return the deepest right leaf node. In case of multiple answers, return the rightmost node.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the given binary tree: \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000000615.PNG\" alt=\"alt-text\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Output: 9\n\nExplanation: The deepest right nodes are 3 and 9 but 9 is the rightmost, thus 9 is the answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of the input contains elements in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The input for the tree depicted in the below image would be : \n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/0000000000004189.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\n1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \n\n2. The input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of output will contain an integer representing the deepest right leaf node of the given binary tree.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print the output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n0 &lt;= data &lt;= 10^5\n\nWhere &#39;N&#39; denotes the number of nodes in the Binary Tree and &#39;data&#39; represents the node value of the nodes in the Binary Tree.\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-to-sample-output-1\">Explanation to Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The input binary tree will be represented as:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/largestbt1-10343.png\" alt=\"alt-text\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>From the above representation, the leaves node are 2 and 3.
