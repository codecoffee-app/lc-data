Now he wants to remove a particular element from the linked list. Can you help Ninja do so and return the final linked list?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains a Linked list of length N separated by space and terminated by -1.\n\nThe second and last line contains an element that has to be removed from the linked list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first and only line of each test case in the output contains the linked list after deleting the required element.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of.
