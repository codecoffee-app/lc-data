Then our answer will be 14. \n\nFirst select arr[1] = 6 and add it to your score. Score will be 6. Now, we also have to delete all elements equal to arr[1] - 1 = 5 and arr[i] + 1 = 7. \n\nIn next move select arr[3] = 8. Delete it and add it to your score. Score = 14. Now, no element is left to be deleted. \n\nSo, our final score is 14, which is the correct answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer, \u2018N\u2019, denoting the size of the array.\n\nThe second contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers representing the elements of the array \u2018arr\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the maximum score possible after performing the operation any number of times.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10 \n1 &lt;= N  &lt;= 10 ^ 6\n1 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 10 ^ 4\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to input or print anything, as it has already been taken care of.

Then our answer will be 24.     \n\nFirst select arr[1] = 4. Delete it and add it to your score. Score will be 4. Now, we also have to delete arr[1] - 1 = 3 and arr[1] + 1 = 5. Then arr = {9, 10, 11}.\n\nIn the next move select arr[0] = 9. Delete it and add it your score. Score = 13. Now, we also have to delete all elements equal to arr[0] - 1 = 8 and arr[0] + 1 = 10. Then arr = {11}.\n\nSelect arr[0] = 11. Delete it and add it to your score. Score = 24.
