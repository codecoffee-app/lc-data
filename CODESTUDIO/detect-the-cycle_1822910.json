If &#39;POS&#39; is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of output contains &#39;true&#39; if the linked list has a cycle or &#39;false&#39; otherwise.\n\nYou don&#39;t have to explicitly print by yourself.
