Then the test cases are as follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018K\u2019, denoting the digit of which you need to count the occurrences.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, denoting the lower and higher limits of the range in which you need to count the occurrence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, you need to print a single integer that denotes occurrences of \u2018K\u2019 in the range [A, B].\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n0 &lt;= K &lt;= 9\n0 &lt;= A, B &lt;= 10^18\n\nwhere \u2018T\u2019 is the number of test cases, \u2018K\u2019 is the digit and \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 are the two integers.\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n1 15\n2\n2 12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-1\">Explanation of sample input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, \nNumber of occurrences of 3 in range [1, 13] = 2 (3, 13).
