For length two, \u201cab\u201d and \u201cba\u201d both occur only once. There is no valid sequence possible for length three as the only subsequence of length three is \u201caba\u201d which is not valid. Hence, the answer is the list of all 5 subsequences created.\n\nIn the second case, \nThe only valid sequences of length one are \u201cx\u201d, \u201cy\u201d and \u201cz\u201d. For length two, \u201cxy\u201d, \u201cxz\u201d and \u201cyz\u201d are valid. For length three \u201cxyz\u201d is valid. Note that repetition is not possible in this case as there are no characters that occur multiple times. Hence, the answer is the list of all 7 subsequences created.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nabca\nzzz\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>a\na\nab\nabc\nac\nb\nba\nbc\nbca\nc\nca\nz\nz\nz\n</code></pre>\n",
