So, the array after the deletions contains 2, 3, and 3. Now, we only have two distinct elements left in the array (2 and 3).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of test cases or queries to be processed. Then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers &#39;N&#39; and &#39;K&#39; representing the size of the array/list and the given integer respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; single space-separated integers representing the array/list elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, i.e. the number of distinct elements left in the array/list.\n\nPrint output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the output, it has already been taken care of.

After deleting these three elements, we are left with array [1, 2]. Hence, we are left with two distinct elements in the array.\n\nFor the second test case we have 10 and 8 as two maximum elements. After deleting these three elements, we are left with array [4, 5].
