So, it is to be divided among 4 people including Ninja himself. In order to maximize the total sweetness of Ninja, one possible division is [5, 6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11], [12, 13]. The minimum sweetness of one part is 17. So, the answer is 17.\n\nIn the second test case, the sweetness of the chunks are [2, 2, 2] and Ninja has 2 friends. So, it is to be divided among 3 people, and there are only 3 chunks. So, all three friends will be getting one chunk each. So, the total sweetness that Ninja will get is 2. So, the answer is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 2\n5 6 7\n10 4\n2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n5\n</code></pre>\n",
