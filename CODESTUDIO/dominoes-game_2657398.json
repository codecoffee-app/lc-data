At the start of the game, you simultaneously pushed some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. After each second, each domino falling to the right pushes the adjacent domino on the right. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling to it from both sides, it stays as it is due to the balance of the forces. You are given a string \u2018S\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019, representing the states of the dominoes where \u2018L\u2019 represents a domino falling in the left direction, \u2018R\u2019 represents domino falling right direction, and \u2018.\u2019 represents domino has not been pushed initially. Print the final state of the dominoes.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>A falling domino exerts no additional force to a falling domino or an already fallen domino.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let \u2018S&#39; be: \u201cR.L\u201d\nThe second domino is pushed from both directions, therefore remains still. \nSo the final state becomes \u201cR.L\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string \u2018S\u2019, representing the initial state of the dominoes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single string representing the final state of the dominoes.\n\nPrint output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
