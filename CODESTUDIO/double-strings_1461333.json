A double string is a string that is made by concatenation of some string with itself.\n\n2. The length of a double string is at least 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>In the string \u2018ababab\u2019, there are just two substrings, that are double strings. Both such substrings are \u2018abab\u2019, and thus there exists only one distinct substring which is a double string. \u2018abab\u2019 can be written as \u2018ab\u2019 + \u2018ab\u2019. But \u2018ababab\u2019 can not be considered as a double string because \u2018ab\u2019 has been concatenated twice with itself. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains the string \u2018STR\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the total number of distinct substrings which are also double strings.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= |STR| &lt; 2000\nWhere \u2018T\u2019 denotes the number of test cases and |STR| represents the length of the string \u2018STR\u2019\n\nTime Limit: 1sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\nabcarcar\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for sample input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In this test case, we can observe that the substring \u2018carcar\u2019 can be written as \u2018car\u2019 + \u2018car\u2019. So, \u2018carcar\u2019 is a double substring. Since, this is the only such substring, we print 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\nabbasdasda\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-2\">Explanation for sample input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In this case, the substring \u2018bb\u2019 can be written as \u2018b\u2019 + \u2018b\u2019. \u2018sdasda\u2019 can be written as \u2018sda\u2019 + \u2018sda\u2019 and \u2018asdasd\u2019 can be written \u2018asd\u2019 + \u2018asd\u2019. So, a total of 3 substrings exist in the given string which are double strings.\n</code></pre>\n",
