Each road has a toll checkpoint, but the tax collection rules are different from the standard toll system. These checkpoints not only take money from you but give you as well.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-government-of-ninja-world-fixed-taxes-for-each-checkpoint-if-the-tax-value-is-positive-you-have-to-pay-that-amount-and-if-the-amount-is-negative-you-receive-that-amount-for-example-if-tax-is-3-dollars-at-a-checkpoint-you-have-to-pay-3-dollars-at-the-checkpoint-if-tax-is-5-dollars-you-receive-5-dollars-from-that-checkpoint\">The government of Ninja world fixed taxes for each checkpoint. If the tax value is positive, you have to pay that amount, and if the amount is negative, you receive that amount. For example, if tax is 3 dollars at a checkpoint, you have to pay 3 dollars at the checkpoint. If tax is -5 dollars, you receive 5 dollars from that checkpoint.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"one-of-your-friends-alice-is-planning-a-trip-in-the-ninja-world-but-wants-to-understand-taxation-very-well-your-task-is-to-provide-him-with-the-minimum-amount-he-needs-to-pay-for-each-pair-of-cities-i-e-print-a-matrix-of-size-n-n-where-matrix-i-j-denotes-minimum-tax-one-needs-to-pay-to-travel-from-city-i-to-city-j-via-some-connecting-roads\">One of your friends, Alice, is planning a trip in the Ninja world but wants to understand taxation very well.
