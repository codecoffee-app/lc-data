There are 3 challenges:\nChallenge 1: Ninja has to eat pizza of 0th type on day 2. The ninja can eat a maximum of 5 pizzas per day.\nOne of the ways is if he eats 2 pizzas of type 0 on day 0, 2 pizzas of type 0 on day 1, 2 pizzas of type 0 on day 2, then he can complete challenge 1. \nThe other way is if he eats 3 pizzas of type 0 on day 0, 2 pizzas of type 0 on day 1, 1 pizza on day 2,  then also he can complete challenge 1. \nIn this way, he can complete challenge 1. So, the answer is 1.\nChallenge 2:\nNinja has to eat pizza of 3rd type on day 2. The ninja can eat a maximum of 3 pizzas per day. Before day 2, he has to eat all the pizzas of type 0 and 1, i.e., he has to eat 6 + 7 = 13 pizzas before day 2, and he can eat a maximum of 3 pizzas, and there are only 2 days. \nIn this way, he can\u2019t complete challenge 2. So, the answer is 0.\nChallenge 3: Ninja has to eat pizza of 3rd type on day 13. The ninja can eat a maximum of 50 pizzas per day.\nHe has to complete all the pizzas of type 0, 1, and 2 before day 13, i.e., eat 6 + 7 + 8 = 21 pizzas before day 13. \nOne of the ways is if he eats 2 pizzas per day from day 1 to day 9, and then eats 1 pizza per day from day 10 to day 12, then he can eat all 21 pizzas on day 12 and start eating pizza of type 3 on day 13. \nIn this way, he can complete challenge 3. So, the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, there are 4 different types of pizzas, and the given array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. There are 2 challenges:\nChallenge 1: \nNinja has to eat pizza of the 0th type on day 2. The ninja can eat a maximum of 5 pizzas per day.\nThere is only 1 pizza of type 0, which he has to eat on day 1, and after that, there is no pizza of type 0 remaining. \nIn this way, he can\u2019t complete challenge 1. So, the answer is 0.\nChallenge 2:\nNinja has to eat pizza of 3rd type on day 2. The ninja can eat a maximum of 10 pizzas per day. \nOne of the ways is that he can eat 1 pizza of type 0 on day 0, eat 2 pizzas of type 1 on day 1 and then eat pizza of type 3 on day 2. In this way, he can complete challenge 2. So, the answer is 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n7 3\n4 5 7 6 8 2 4 \n5 5 9\n1 3 1 \n3 2 5 \n6 3\n12 14 16 18 20 22 \n1 2 10 \n2 3 4 \n4 5 20 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 0 0\n1 0 1\n</code></pre>\n",
