For example :- If we have an array &#39;A&#39; = [2, 3, 5, 6, 1], then we can replace the subarray from index 1 to index 3 (0-based indexing) i.e. [3, 5, 6] with its sum i.e. 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 to get &#39;A&#39; =  [2, 14, 1].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-want-to-make-a-and-b-equal-return-the-maximum-possible-length-of-arrays-a-and-b-such-that-a-is-equal-to-b-if-it-is-impossible-to-make-a-and-b-equal-then-return-1\">You want to make &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B&#39; equal.
