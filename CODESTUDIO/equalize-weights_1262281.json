Then, the \u2018T\u2019 test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the total number of bags. The next 2*\u2019N\u2019 lines contain the following :\n\nThe first line contains a single integer \u2018M\u2019, denoting the number of items in the bag.\n\nThe second line contains \u2018M\u2019 space-separated integers, denoting the value of each item in the bag.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print in a new line the contents of every bag in non-decreasing order. \n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n\nThe contents of all the bags must be printed in separate lines, and the following rules must be followed :\n\nThe contents of the bag that contains the item having the least value must be printed on the first line. \n\nThe contents of the bag that contains the item having the second least value must be printed on the second line and so on and so forth. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
