Similarly, for index = 6 the sum of elements at lower indices [-7+1+5+2+(-4)+3] is equal to the sum of higher indices(since it is the last element, the sum of higher indices is 0 as explained above). Hence we return the sequence [3, 6] which are the equilibrium indices.\n\nIn test case 2, for each index, we find the sum of all the values present at indices lower than the index and greater than the index. Consider index = 2, sum of elements present at indices lower than 2 is (1+ 2 = 3), and the sum of elements present at indices higher than 2 is (4 + 5 = 9), Because the sum doesn\u2019t match, the index 2 is not at equilibrium. We can check in a similar way for all the indices of the sequence and conclude no index satisfies the equilibrium condition, therefore we return an empty sequence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n7\n-2 1 9 2 -6 3 0\n4\n100 -99 2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-output-1\">Explanation of Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In test case 1, in the given sequence of indices, index 2 (consider 0 based indexing) is the equilibrium index, because the sum of the elements present at the indices lower than 2 i.e [-2 + 1 = -1 ] is equal to sum of all the elements present at indices higher than 2 i.e [ 2 + -6 + 3 + 0 = -1].
