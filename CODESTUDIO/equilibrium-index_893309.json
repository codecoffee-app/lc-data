There are \u2018N\u2019 checkpoints in between their homes numbered from 0 to N - 1, where checkpoint 0 is closest to Alex and checkpoint N - 1 is closest to Rome. Each checkpoint has a token with a number written on it. If someone crosses some checkpoint, he will collect the token. Alex and Rome will meet at some checkpoint \u2018i\u2019, 0 &lt;= i &lt;= N - 1. They aim to have the same total sum of numbers on the tokens they have collected individually when they meet at the checkpoint \u2018i\u2019. They don\u2019t want any fights, so no one will take the token at checkpoint \u2018i\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-array-token-consisting-of-n-integers-signifying-the-number-on-each-token-find-out-the-checkpoint-number-i-such-that-alex-and-rome-will-have-the-same-sum-of-numbers-on-their-tokens-since-alex-is-lazy-find-out-the-index-closest-to-alex-such-that-the-above-conditions-hold-also-notify-if-no-such-checkpoints-exist\">You are given an array \u2018token\u2019 consisting of \u2018N\u2019 integers, signifying the number on each token.

Checkpoint 0 is closest to Alex, and N-1 is closest to Rome. Each checkpoint has a token with a number on it.  When someone passes a checkpoint, they collect the token. They want to meet at a checkpoint 'i' (0 <= i <= N-1) such that the sum of the token values collected by Alex equals the sum of the token values collected by Rome.
