You need to simplify the polynomial in general form by evaluating and simplifying the expression.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the given polynomial equation is \u201c5x ^ 3 + 2x ^ 3 + 6x ^ 4 + 2\u201d. There are two terms of exponent or degree 3 and they are 5x ^ 3 and 2x ^ 3. Both these terms will get added and form 7x ^ 3, so the given polynomial will be simplified as 7x ^ 3 + 6x ^ 4 + 2. Now by arranging the expression in the decreasing order of the degrees, we will have 6x ^ 4 + 7x ^ 3 + 2 and hence the result.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases/queries to be run. \nThen the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer &#39;N&#39; which represents the number of terms in the polynomial.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; integers denoting the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; integers denoting the degree of the polynomial.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers denoting the coefficient and degree of the term respectively.\nThe result will be printed in descending order of the degrees.\n\nThe output for each test case will be printed in a new line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 5\n-10 ^ 5 &lt;= coefficient &lt;= 10 ^ 5\n0 &lt;= degree &lt;= 10 ^ 5\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n-1 1 0\n1 1 0\n4\n2 1 4 2\n2 2 7 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4 7\n3 2\n2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-input-1\">Explanation of Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, we have no non-zero term so return an empty array.\n\nFor the second test case, if we represent our input to the polynomial expression it will be \u201c2x ^ 2 + 1x ^ 2 + 4x ^ 7 + 2x\u201c so after simplifying it will be \u201c4x ^ 7 + 3x ^ 2 + 2x\u201d thus output would be \n4 7\n3 2\n2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n5\n-1 2 3 6 -1\n4 3 1 4 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5 4\n2 3\n3 1\n-1 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-input-2\">Explanation of Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Representing the input to the polynomial expression it will be \u201c-1x ^ 4 + 2x ^ 3 + 3x ^ 1 + 6x ^ 4 + -1\u201c so after simplifying and arranging it in descreasing order of the exponent it will be \u201c5x ^ 4 + 2x ^ 3 + 3x -1\u201d thus output would be \n5 4\n2 3\n3 1\n-1 0\n</code></pre>\n",
