There is a one-one mapping between nuts and bolts. Your task is to find the correct match of nuts and bolts from the given set and assign a nut to a bolt when it is matched.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. A comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with a nut to see which one is bigger/smaller.\n\n2. The set of Nuts/Bolts will consist of numeric strings that represent their sizes. The size of each nut/bolt will be equal to its numerical value. For example, the size of \u201810\u2019 will be equal to 10. \n\n3. For every bolt, there will exist a nut of the same size.\n\n4. Don\u2019t return or print anything. Modify the original sequence of nuts and bolts such that each nut of a particular size matches its bolt of the same size.\n\n5. Store the matched pair of nuts and bolts in any order. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next \u20183*T\u2019 lines represent the \u2018T\u2019 test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of nuts/bolts.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated strings denoting the nuts of different sizes.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated strings denoting bolts of different sizes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, 2 arrays will be printed on separate lines such that the first array contains the nuts, the second array contains the bolts and the nut present at the \u2018ith\u2019 position in the array of nuts should be a perfect match for the bolt present at the \u2018ith\u2019 position in the array of bolts.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
