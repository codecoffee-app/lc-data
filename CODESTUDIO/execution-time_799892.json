Each function has a unique \u2018ID\u2019 between 0 and (N-1) and each time it starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the TIMESTAMP.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-a-2d-array-of-integers-containing-information-about-l-logs-where-ith-column-represents-the-ith-log-message-each-column-contains-3-rows-to-describe-the-ith-log-where\">You are given a 2D array of integers containing information about \u2018L\u2019 logs where ith column represents the ith log message. Each column contains 3 rows to describe the ith log where,</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1st Row - represents the ID of the function.\n\n2nd Row - represents whether the function has started or ended where 1 denotes the start and -1 denotes the end.\n\n3rd Row - represents the TIMESTAMP of the log.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-required-to-return-an-array-where-the-value-at-the-ith-index-represents-the-exclusive-time-for-the-function-with-id-i\">You are required to return an array where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID \u2018i\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. The exclusive time of a function is the sum of execution times for all calls of that function.\n\n2. A function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n\n3. No two events will happen at the same time where an event denotes either a start or end of a function call. This basically means no two logs have the same timestamp. \n\n4. Each function has an end log for each start log. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the following input\n0 1 1 1 2 2 1 0\n1 1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1\n0 2 5 7 8 10 11 14\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/exclusive-5761.JPG\" alt=\"alt-text\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Thus, we return [5, 7, 3] as a process with ID 0 has taken 5 units of time and process with ID 1 has taken 7 units of time and process ID 2 has taken 3 units of time. A process\u2019s exclusive time is the sum of exclusive times for all function calls in the program. As process Id 1 has called itself so exclusive time is the sum of exclusive times(5 + 2).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. \nThen the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019, representing the number of unique functions and number of logs respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018L\u2019 single space-separated integers representing the function ID for each log.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains \u2018L\u2019 single space-separated integers(1 or -1), where 1 represent a function that has started execution and -1 represent a function that has ended the execution\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains L single space-separated integers, representing the \u2018TIMESTAMP.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print &#39;N&#39; single space-separated integers, representing the exclusive time of each function in a single line.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
