If there are multiple such pairs, return the one where X is maximum.</h4>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>A = 2\nB = 4\nThe answer should be D = 2 [gcd of (2,4)] and X = 1  and Y = 0 (|X+Y|=1 is the minimum possible value that can be obtained here).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of every test case contains two integers \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 denoting the 2 coefficients.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print three integers \u2018D\u2019, \u2018X\u2019, and \u2018Y\u2019 where \u2018D\u2019 is the gcd of \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 are the two coefficients that satisfy the equation AX + BY = D.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= A &lt;= 10^9\n1 &lt;= B &lt;= 10^9\n\nTime Limit = 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 6\n17 17\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2 -1 1\n17 1 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the GCD of 4 and 6 is 2. So, X=-1 and Y=1 satisfy the equation AX+BY=D with |X+Y| being minimum.\n\nIn the second test case, the GCD of 17 and 17 is 17. So, X=1 and Y=0 satisfy the equation AX+BY=D with |X+Y| being minimum.\nNote that X=0,Y=1 also satisfies the equation with minimum |X+Y| but the value of X is smaller.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n1 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 1 0\n</code></pre>\n",
