Your task is to find the sum of the total number of factors from 1 to N modulo 2. A number X is called a factor of K if K mod X is 0 (the remainder when K is divided by X is 0).</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>N=3\nAnswer:- 1 ( 1 has 1 factor , 2 has 2 factors and 3 has 2 factors , so total 5 and 5 % 2 = 1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.
