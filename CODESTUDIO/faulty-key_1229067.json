But, due to some faults in his keyboard, he can not use the \u201c+\u201d, operator, which means he is not able to simply return \u2018A\u2019 + \u2018B\u2019, where \u2018A\u2019 and &#39;B&#39; are the numbers to be added. You need to help Ninja in finding the sum of two numbers without using the &quot;+&quot; operator anywhere in your code.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code> You should also not use the increment &quot;++&quot; operator too.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given A = 4, B = 6, their sum = 10, you need to return 10.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.
