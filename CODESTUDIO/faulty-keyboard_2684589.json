The text is typed correctly if some characters were long pressed (typed multiple times) while typing the \u2018Expected\u2019 text.

This if followed by correctly pressing \u2018b\u2019 once and in the end he might long press \u2018c\u2019 resulting in typing it twice, the resulting text typed in this case is equal to \u201caaabcc\u201d and therefore we will return \u201ctrue\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string \u2018Expected\u2019 that denotes the original text that was to be typed.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string \u2018Typed\u2019 that denotes the text that was actually typed.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the \u201ctrue\u201d if the text was typed correctly, else print \u201cfalse\u201d.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
