Finally, find the average waiting time and average turnaround time for the given processes.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. All the processes will have different arrival times.\n\n2. In the FCFS scheduling algorithm, processes that come first ( i.e have lesser arrival time) will be executed first.\n\n3. Turn around time of a Process is the time difference between arrival time and the time at which the process completed.\n\n4. The waiting time of a process is the total time, the process is waiting, i.e. difference between turnaround time and burst time.\n\n5. Completion time is the time at which a process completes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let there be 4 Processes with the following arrival time and burst time.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/1-8894.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Wait time, turnaround, and completion time for each process are:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/2-8895.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.
