If an employee didn't work in those preceding months, consider their salary as 0 for those months.\n2.  **Exclusion of Recent Month:**  Do not include the 3-month sum for the most recent month the employee worked.\n3.  **Exclusion of Non-Worked Months:** Only include 3-month sums for months the employee actually worked.\n4.  **Ordering:** The result table should be ordered first by `Id` in ascending order, and then by `Month` in descending order in case of ties.",
