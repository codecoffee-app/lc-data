A server can only handle one request at a time. You are given a strictly increasing array of size \u2018K\u2019 say \u2018requestTime\u2019 that represents the incoming time of \u2018K\u2019 requests, and an array \u2018processTime\u2019 of size \u2018K\u2019 that represents the time required to complete each request.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"to-work-efficiently-incoming-requests-are-handled-in-the-following-way\">To work efficiently, incoming requests are handled in the following way.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. The \u2018i - th\u2019 request comes at time \u2018request[i]\u2019.\n\n2. The \u2018i - th\u2019 request will initially go to \u2018(i % N) - th\u2019 server if it is busy, i.e. already processing any request. Then this request will move to the next server i.e \u2018( i  + 1) % N -th\u2019 server until it finds a free server. \n\n3. If all servers are busy at the time \u2018request[i]\u2019, then this request will be discarded. I.e. it will not be handled by any server.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-need-to-find-all-servers-that-accept-a-maximum-number-of-requests\">You need to find all servers that accept a maximum number of requests.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let the number of servers be \u20183\u2019,  \u2018requestTime\u2019 be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and \u2018processTime\u2019 be [5, 7, 1, 4, 5]\n\nThe requests will be handled in the following order -\n1. Initially all servers are free, \u20180 - th\u2019 request will come at time \u2018t\u2019 = 1 and it will initially go to ( 0%3 ) server i.e server -0. It will accept the request and complete it in time \u2018t\u2019 = 1+ 5.\n\n2. Request - 1 will come at time \u2018t\u2019 = 2, initially it will go to (1 % 3) server i.e server - 1, as it is free, it will accept the request and complete it in time \u2018t\u2019 = 2 + 7.\n\n3. Request - 2 will come at time \u2018t\u2019 = 3 and initially it will go to (2 % 3) server i.e. server - 2, and server - 2 will accept the request and complete it in time \u2018t\u2019 = 3 + 1\n\n4. Request - 3 will come at time \u2018t\u2019 = 4 and initially it will go to ( 3 % 3) server i.e. server - 0. But this server is busy in Processing \u20180 - th\u2019 request, thus request[3] will move to server - 2, server -2 is also busy in processing request[1], then request[3] will move to server - 3, As this server is free. It will accept the request and complete it in time \u2018t\u2019 = 4 + 5.\n\n5. Request -4 will come at time \u2018t\u2019 = 5, but all servers are busy at this moment so this request will be discarded.\n\nAfter all requests are completed, we see that server - 0 and server - 1 have handled 1 request each, and server - 2 has handled 2 requests. So the answer will be \u2018server - 2\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. The description of \u2018T\u2019 test cases follows\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 representing the number of servers and number of incoming requests.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018K\u2019 space-separated integers, representing the incoming time of each request, \u2018requestTime\u2019.\n\nThe last line of the test cases contains \u2018K\u2019 space-separated integers, representing the processing time of each request, \u2018processTime\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing \u2018X\u2019 space-separated integers representing the index of servers that handled a maximum number of requests, where \u2018X\u2019 is the total number of servers that handled a maximum number of requests.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

You are also given a strictly increasing array 'requestTime' of size 'K' representing the arrival times of 'K' requests, and an array 'processTime' of size 'K' indicating the processing time required for each request. The goal is to determine which servers handle the maximum number of requests, following a specific request assignment strategy. The 'i-th' request arrives at 'requestTime[i]' and initially tries to be assigned to server '(i % N)'. If that server is busy, the request iterates through servers '(i + 1) % N', '(i + 2) % N', and so on until a free server is found. If all servers are busy when a request arrives, the request is discarded. Return a list of server indices that handled the maximum number of requests.",
