So the first minimum slope is between nodes (3,2) and (4,3) so we print the first node i.e (3, 2) and the first maximum slope is between nodes (3,2) and (4,3) so we print the first node i.e (3, 2).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 3 8 6 2 9 4 18 -1\n2 9 4 18 4 3 8 6 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>8 6 2 9 \n4 3 4 18 \n</code></pre>\n",
