There are N petrol pumps on this path that are numbered from 0 to N - 1 (Both inclusive). Each petrol pump has two values associated with it:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"1-the-amount-of-petrol-that-is-available-at-this-particular-petrol-pump\">1)The amount of petrol that is available at this particular petrol pump.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"2-the-distance-to-reach-the-next-petrol-pump\">2)The distance to reach the next petrol pump.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-on-a-truck-having-an-empty-tank-of-infinite-capacity-you-can-start-the-tour-from-any-of-the-petrol-pumps-your-task-is-to-calculate-the-first-petrol-pump-from-where-the-truck-will-be-able-to-complete-the-full-circle-or-determine-if-it-is-impossible-to-do-so\">You are on a truck having an empty tank of infinite capacity.

The truck will move one kilometre for each litre of petrol consumed.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;N&#39; representing the number of petrol pumps.\n\nEach of the next N lines will contain a pair of space-separated integers representing the amount of petrol that pump has and the distance to reach the next petrol pump, respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Print an integer representing the index of the first petrol pump from which we should start the tour.
