One such ninja was challenged by another if they could solve a problem to find the Kth number in a list of given elements (array) comprising of only 3, 5 and 7 as their prime factors. Despite the ninja\u2019s strong will to solve the problem, you know that it could be easily solved with the help of knowledge of programming. Since the ninja does not know that you\u2019ll have to devise an algorithm for solving the problem. Your task is to complete the given function which returns that required Kth element from the array.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: &#39;K&#39; = 10\nOutput: 45\n\nThe array will contain elements that only have 3, 5 or 7 as their prime factors i.e. of  the following form:-  3,5,7,9,15,21,25,\u2026. Therefore we can see from the above pattern of elements that 45 would be the 10th element in the array which is our  required answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run. \nThen the test cases follow:-\n\nThe first and the only line of each test contains an integer &#39;K&#39;, denoting the Kth number that we want.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the Kth element from the array. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= 3 * 10^3\n\nTime limit: 1 second\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n9         \n5         \n10\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>35\n15\n45\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-1\">Explanation for sample 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The array will contain elements that only have 3, 5 or 7 as their prime factors i.e. of the following form:-  3,5,7,9,15,21,25,27,35,45\u2026.\nTherefore we can see from the above pattern of elements that the 9th, 5th and 10th elements would be 35, 15 and 45 respectively. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n12\n8\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>63\n27\n</code></pre>\n",
