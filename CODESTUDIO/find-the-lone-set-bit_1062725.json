Your task is to find the position of the only \u20181\u2019 digit. In other words, your task is to find the position of the only set bit in the binary representation of the input integer \u2018N\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-position-of-the-set-bit-must-be-counted-from-the-lsb-least-significant-bit-end-of-the-binary-number-if-the-count-of-set-bits-in-the-binary-number-is-not-equal-to-1-then-your-function-should-return-1-as-output\">The position of the set bit must be counted from the LSB (Least Significant Bit) end of the Binary number. If the count of set bits in the Binary number is not equal to 1, then your function should return \u2018-1\u2019 as output.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>INPUT   : N = 4\nOUTPUT  : 3\n\nIn the above example, N = 4, whose Binary representation is \u201c0100\u201d. It is clearly visible that the binary number contains a single set bit, at a position 3 from the LSB end. Hence the output is 3\n\nINPUT : N = 8\nOUTPUT: 4\n\nIn the above example, N = 8, whose Binary representation is \u201c1000\u201d. It is clearly visible that the binary number contains a single set bit, at a position 4 from the LSB end. Hence the output is 4\n\nINPUT   : N = 9\nOUTPUT  : -1\n\nIn the above example, N = 9, whose Binary representation is \u201c1001\u201d.  Now, the binary number contains 2 set bits, at a position 4 and 1 from LSB end. Hence the output is -1.\n\nINPUT   : N = 0\nOUTPUT  : -1\n\nIn the above example, N = 0, whose Binary representation is \u201c0000\u201d.  Now, the binary number contains no set bits at all. Hence the output will be -1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of the test case.

The set bit is at position 2 from the LSB end. Hence the output is 2\n\nIn the second test case, N = 8, whose Binary equivalent is \u201c1000\u201d. The set bit is at position 4 from the LSB end. Hence the output is 4\n\nIn the third test case, K = 11, whose Binary equivalent is \u201c1011\u201d. The count of the total number of set bits is 3 which is not equal to 1. Hence the output is -1\n\nIn the fourth test case, K = 0, whose Binary equivalent is \u201c0000\u201d, which contains no set bits at all.
