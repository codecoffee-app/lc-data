                        "explanation": "By sorting the subarray {6, 5, 1, 9}, the array becomes {2, 1, 5, 6, 9, 10}, which is still not sorted completely. However, after sorting subarray {6,5,1} (length 3) or {6,5,1,9} (length 4), the resulting array can be sorted. If we consider the subarray {6,5,1}, the array will become {2,1,5,6,9,10}, which is still not sorted. If we take subarray {6,5,1,9} and sort it, the array becomes {2, 1,5,6,9,10}, which will not solve the problem.  However, notice that {6, 5, 1} doesn't work and {2, 6, 5, 1} gives a result {1,2,5,6} that will leave the whole array sorted. So after sorting the subarray {6,5,1}, the array becomes {2,1,5,6,9,10} which is not sorted at all. Sorting {2,6,5,1} results in {1,2,5,6}. If we choose {6,5,1} the sorted array should be {2,1,5,6,9,10} that is not the solution. \n\nThe crucial correction:  The subarray to sort is actually {6, 5, 1,9 }. Notice after sorting subarray {6,5,1,9}, we get {1,5,6,9}. The whole array becomes {2, 1,5,6,9,10}, which is still not sorted. However, if we sort the correct subarray {2, 6, 5, 1}, the array becomes {1, 2, 5, 6}, and the whole array will be {1,2,5,6,9,10} sorted array. therefore the subarray to sort should be {2,6,5,1} . So the length is 4."
