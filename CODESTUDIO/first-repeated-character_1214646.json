You need to find the repeated character present first in the string.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the string is: \u201cabccba\u201d, then the first repeated character is \u2018c\u2019, but the repeated character that is present first in the string is \u2018a\u2019. You need to print \u2018a\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Keep in mind that you need to print the repeated character that is present first in the string and not the first repeating character.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case will contain a string \u2018S\u2019, which denotes the string of lowercase English alphabets.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the repeated character that occurs first in the string. If no repeated character is found then print \u2018%\u2019.\n\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. \n\nYou just need to complete the \u201crepeatedCharacter\u201d function that returns the first repeating character in the string. In case there is no repeating character then return \u201c%\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 200\n0 &lt;= size of S &lt;= 10000\n\nwhere &#39;S\u2019 is the string of lowercase English alphabets.\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nabccba\ncodingninjas\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>a\ni\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-1\">Explanation of sample input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, \nThe repeated character that occurs first in the string is \u2018a\u2019\n\nIn the second test case, \nThe repeated character that occurs first in the string is \u2018i\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\nhello\nhelloh\nabc\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>l\nh\n%\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-2\">Explanation for sample input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, \nThe repeated character that occurs first in the string is \u2018l\u2019\n\nIn the second test case, \nThe repeated character that occurs first in the string is \u2018h\u2019\n\nIn the third test case, \nThere is no repeating character in the string, so print \u2018%\u2019\n</code></pre>\n",
