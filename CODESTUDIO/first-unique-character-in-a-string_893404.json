For the second stream of characters, i.e., after reading character \u2018b\u2019 from the stream, the string becomes \u201cbb\u201d, for which all the characters are repeating, so no need to add in the arraylist. For the third stream of characters, \u201cbba\u201d, the first non-repeating character is \u2018a\u2019, so add \u2018a\u2019 in the arraylist. In this way, the first non-repeating character is added to the arraylist for each stream of characters.\n\nFor the second test case, \u2018b\u2019 is the first non-repeating character for the first stream, \u201cb\u201d. For the stream \u201cba\u201d, the first non-repeating character so far \u2018b\u2019. For the stream \u201cbab\u201d, the first non-repeating character so far is \u2018a\u2019. So, the final arraylist will be [b, a, a].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\ncbbd\nbebeeed\nabcd\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>c c c c\nb b e d\na a a a\n</code></pre>\n",
