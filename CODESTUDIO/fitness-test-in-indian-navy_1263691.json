In this test, there will be a group of 3 trainees appearing for the swimming test in the sea for three rounds. The oxygen level remaining of each trainee will be recorded after each round in 2D matrix/list \u2018OXYGEN\u2019 of size 3 x 3.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"after-the-trainee-is-finished-with-all-rounds-an-officer-from-the-indian-navy-calculates-each-trainees-remaining-oxygen-level-over-the-three-rounds-and-selects-one-with-the-highest-average-oxygen-level-as-the-fittest-trainee-if-more-than-one-trainee-attains-the-same-highest-average-level-they-all-need-to-be-chosen\">After the trainee is finished with all rounds, an Officer from the Indian Navy calculates each trainee&#39;s remaining oxygen level over the three rounds and selects one with the highest average oxygen level as the fittest trainee.

The remaining oxygen level should only be  accepted if it is in the range between [1, 100] both inclusive else the oxygen level will be marked as 0.\n2. If the calculated maximum average oxygen remaining value of trainees is below 70, then declare the trainees as unfit with the meaningful message as \u201cUnfit.\u201d\n3. The average remaining Oxygen level should be rounded.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/example-8351.png\" alt=\"img\">\n<br>\n</br></p>\n\n<pre><code>Output for the above case will be\nTrainee1\nUnfit\nTrainee3\n\nBecause the maximum average is 70 which is in the range and Trainee 1 and 3 both have the same value.\nTrainee 2 is unfit because the average is below 70. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases to be run.

(10 + 50 + 30) / 3 = 30, which is less than 70 so the trainee is unfit.\n2. (30 + 80 + 90) / 3 = 66.66, which becomes 66 on rounding up which is less than 70 so the trainee is unfit. \n3. (60 + 90 + 80) / 3 = 76.66, which becomes 76 on rounding up which is in the range and maximum among all.\n\nFor the second test case:\nFollowing are the average of remaining oxygen level of 3 trainees:\n1. (90 + 90 + 90) / 3 = 90, so the trainee\u2019s average oxygen level is in the range.\n2. (70 + 70 + 70) / 3 = 70, so the trainee\u2019s average oxygen level is in the range.\n3. (0 + 0 + 98) / 3 = 66.33. Here, we added 0 instead of 101 because as given in the problem the value out of the range [1, 100] is to be treated as 0. 66.33 on rounding up gives 66 which is less than 70 so the trainee is unfit.\nTrainee1 is the fittest among all and trainee3 is unfit.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n55 56 84\n94 85 76\n12 21 34\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Unfit\nTrainee2\nUnfit\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-2\">Explanation For Sample Output 2 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case:\nFollowing are the average of remaining oxygen level of 3 trainees:\n1.
