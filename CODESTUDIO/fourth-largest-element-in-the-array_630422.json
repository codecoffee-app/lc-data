                        "explanation": "The distinct elements are 5, 3, and 1. After sorting in descending order, we have 5, 3, 1. The fourth largest element doesn't exist, but the question asks for the fourth largest DISTINCT element. Here the array of distinct elements are 5,3,1.  The 1st largest is 5, 2nd largest is 3, and the 3rd largest is 1.  Since we need to find the 4th largest, and the size is only 3, then we sort a descending order of array and return the 4th element. in this case it doesn't exist so we find the 3rd largest element. However in the sample case it wants the value 1 returned. The array has distinct elements {5,3,1}. Since we want the fourth largest element and the array has less then 4 elements we take the sorted distinct array {5,3,1} and then in this case we can say the 4th largest doesn't exist. But in the sample it wants it to follow the pattern of the distinct largest element, then in this case the 1 is the next largest element."
