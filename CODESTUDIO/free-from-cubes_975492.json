So cube free numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 etc (we will consider 1 as cube free). 8, 16, 24, 27, 32, etc are not cube-free numbers. So the position of 1 among the cube-free numbers is 1, the position of 2 is 2, 3 is 3, and the position of 10 is 9.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"more-formally-given-a-positive-number-you-have-to-say-if-its-a-cube-free-number-and-if-yes-then-tell-its-position-among-cube-free-numbers-else-return-1\">More formally, given a positive number you have to say if it&#39;s a cube-free number and if yes then tell its position among cube-free numbers, else return -1.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Given:\n\u2018N\u2019 = 4, Yes 4 is a cube-free number since it&#39;s only divisor 2 is not a cube of any number and the position of 4 is 4 itself as a cube free number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe following \u2018T\u2019 lines contain a single integer  \u2018N\u2019, denoting the number given to us.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, You are supposed to return an integer that denotes the minimum steps it takes to reduce the number to 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of.
