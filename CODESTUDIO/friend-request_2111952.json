Return the answer rounded to 2 decimals places.\n\n  Note that:\n\n The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.\nIt is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the \u2018duplicated\u2019 requests or acceptances are only counted once.\nIf there are no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.\nThe query result format is in the following example:\n\n\n\nFriendRequest table:\n+-----------+------------+--------------+\n| sender_id | send_to_id | request_date |\n+-----------+------------+--------------+\n| 1         | 2          | 2016/06/01   |\n| 1         | 3          | 2016/06/01   |\n| 1         | 4          | 2016/06/01   |\n| 2         | 3          | 2016/06/02   |\n| 3         | 4          | 2016/06/09   |\n+-----------+------------+--------------+\n\nRequestAccepted table:\n+--------------+-------------+-------------+\n| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |\n+--------------+-------------+-------------+\n| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |\n| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |\n| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |\n| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |\n| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/10  |\n+--------------+-------------+-------------+\n\nResult table:\n+-------------+\n| unique_accepted_request |\n+-------------+\n| 4        |\n+-------------+\n\n+-------------+\n| total_request |\n+-------------+\n| 5           |\n+-------------+\n\n There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total.
