He has two baskets and wants to put the maximum number of fruits in them.

He picks one fruit from tree 0 and put it in the first basket, then he picks one fruit from tree 1 and put it in the first basket, then he picks one fruit from tree 2 and put it in the second basket, he cannot pick fruit from tree 3 because the first basket has the fruit of type 1 and second has the fruit of type 2 and type of fruit in tree-3 is 3. \n\nThus he has to stop there. The number of fruits he picks in this way is 3. We can show that this is the maximum possible number of fruits ninjas can pick.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4\n1 2 3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-2\">Explanation of Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>There are four trees, and each of them has different types of fruit.
