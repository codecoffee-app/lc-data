Ninja initially has a health level \u2018H\u2019 and his spaceship has an armour \u2018A\u2019. He decides to play a game, where at any instant he can be only on one of the 3 planets: VENUS, MARS or SATURN. At every unit of time, he has to change his location and you can assume he can change his location instantly. Each planet has different  effects on health and armour which are :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Venus: Decreases health by 4, decreases armour by 8.\nMars: Increases health by 3, increases armour by 2. \nSaturn: Decreases health by 10, increases armour by 5. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-the-game-will-end-if-either-h-0-or-a-0\">Now the game will end if either \u2018H\u2019 &lt;= 0 or \u2018A\u2019 &lt;= 0.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-maximum-time-ninja-can-survive\">Your task is to find the maximum time Ninja can survive.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You can choose any of the 3 planets during your first move.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases.\n\nThen the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of every test case contains 2 single space-separated integers representing initial health and initial armour respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case, print a single integer representing the maximum time Ninja can survive.\n\nThe output of each test case is printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Health will increase by 3 and armour will increase by 2, resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 8 and  \u2018A\u2019 = 10.\nThe second move will be to Venus resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 4 (8-4) and \u2018A\u2019 = 2 (10-8).\nThe third move will be to Mars resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 7 (4+3) and \u2018A\u2019 = 4 (2+2).\nNow, we can either move to Venus or Saturn. Moving to Venus makes \u2018A\u2019 = -4 (4-8) and ends the game. Moving to Saturn makes \u2018H\u2019 = -3 (7-10) and ends the game. Therefore, we can not make any move.\nSo the sequence is Mars -&gt;Venus -&gt; Mars and the maximum survival time is 3 units.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n8 4\n3 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>3\n1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-2\">Explanation for sample output 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>(I) For the first test case:\nNinja has initial health \u2018H\u2019 = 7 and initial armour \u2018A\u2019 = 4.\nSo our first move will be to Mars and health will increase by 3 and armour will increase by 2, resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 11 and  \u2018A\u2019 = 6.\nThe second move will be to Saturn resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 1 (11-10) and \u2018A\u2019 = 11 (5+6).\nThe third move will be to Mars resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 4 (1+3) and \u2018A\u2019 = 13 (11+2).\nNow we can not make any move.\nSo the sequence is Mars -&gt; Saturn -&gt; Mars and the maximum survival time is 3 units.\n\n(II) For the second test case:\nNinja has initial health \u2018H\u2019 = 3 and initial armour \u2018A\u2019 = 3.\nSo our first move will be to Mars and health will increase by 3 and armour will increase by 2, resulting in \u2018H\u2019 = 6 and  \u2018A\u2019 = 5.\nNow we can not make any move.\nThe maximum survival time is 1 unit as Ninja has visited only Mars.\n</code></pre>\n",
