Nikhil gave Ankush \u2018N\u2019 integers and asked how many groups of sizes 2 and 3 can be formed such that the sum of the group is divisible by 3. Although the Ultimate Ninja Ankush is brilliant, some extra help is always appreciated. Can you help The ultimate ninja Ankush with this so that he can prove to Nikhil that he, in fact, is the ultimate ninja?</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"more-formally-given-an-array-of-size-n-we-can-form-a-group-of-two-or-three-the-group-should-be-such-that-the-sum-of-all-elements-in-that-group-is-a-multiple-of-3-count-all-possible-numbers-of-groups-that-can-be-generated-in-this-way\">More formally, Given an array of size \u2018N\u2019, we can form a group of two or three. The group should be such that the sum of all elements in that group is a multiple of 3.
