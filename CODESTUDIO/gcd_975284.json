Your task is to find the greatest common divisor of the given two numbers.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-greatest-common-divisor-of-any-two-integers-is-the-largest-number-that-divides-both-integers\">The Greatest Common Divisor of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given \u2018X\u2019 as 20 and \u2018Y\u2019 as 15. The greatest common divisor, which divides both 15 and 20, is 5. Hence the answer is 5.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains \u2018T\u2019, representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019, representing the given numbers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer representing the Greatest Common Divisor of \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019.\n\nPrint a separate line for each test case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note-c-python\">Note (c++, python):</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= X, Y &lt;= 10^9\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n20 15\n8 32\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n8\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, the greatest common divisor which divides both 15 and 20 is 5. Hence the answer is 5.\n\nFor the second test case, the greatest common divisor which divides both 8 and 32 is 8. Hence the answer is 8.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n98 56\n36 60\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>14\n12\n</code></pre>\n",
