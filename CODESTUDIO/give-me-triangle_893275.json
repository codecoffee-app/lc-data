Can you help solve this problem?</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Example : Pattern for N = 4\n\n****\n ***     \n  **\n   *\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.

Hence the answer is [\u201c***\u201d,\u201d**\u201d,\u201d*\u201d].\n\n In the second test case, the value of \u2018N\u2019 is 2, so the two rows are to be printed from 1 to 3 where each row starts from 3, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [\u201c**\u201d,\u201d*\u201d].\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sample Input 2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>****\n ***     \n  **\n   *\n\n*****\n ****     \n  ***\n   **\n    *\n</code></pre>\n",
