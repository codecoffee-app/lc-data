Each bulb is assigned a unique integer starting from 1.  There are \u2018N\u2019 switches also and each switch is labeled by a unique prime number.  If a switch labeled with prime integer \u2018p\u2019 is turned ON, then all the bulbs having a number that is multiple of \u2018p\u2019 will start glowing. For example, if we turn ON the switch labelled 2, then all the bulbs having numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...  i.e all bulbs with numbers as multiples of 2 will start glowing.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-array-list-labels-consisting-of-n-unique-prime-integers-representing-the-label-of-the-switches-and-an-integer-k-your-task-is-to-find-the-integer-assigned-to-kth-glowing-bulb-from-the-start-when-all-these-n-switches-are-turned-on\">You are given an array/list \u2018LABELS\u2019 consisting of \u2018N\u2019 unique prime integers representing the label of the switches and an integer \u2018K\u2019.

Some bulbs can glow by multiple switches and some are not glowed by any switch.\n2. If any of the switches that can glow a bulb is turned \u2018ON\u2019, then the corresponding bulb will glow.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider 3 switches with labels [3, 5,  7] and we need to find the 5th glowing bulb from the start after turning these 3 switches ON.\nWe can see that bulbs numbered  3, 6, 9, 15, 18 \u2026  will glow if the switch having label 3 is turned ON.\nThe bulbs numbered 5, 10, 15, 20 \u2026 will glow if the switch having label 5 is turned ON.\nThe bulbs numbered 7, 14, 21, 28 \u2026 will glow if the switch having label 7 is turned ON.\nIt implies that bulbs numbered 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21\u2026 will glow when these three switches are turned ON.\nThe 5th glowing bulb from start is assigned integer 9. Thus, we should return 9.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. Then \u2018T\u2019 test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case consists of \u2018N\u2019 space-separated prime integers representing array/list \u2018LABELS\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the integer assigned to the Kth glowing bulb when all the given switches in \u2018LABELS\u2019 are turned ON.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
