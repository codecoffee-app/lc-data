So they are grouped together. The distance between the third point and the second point is 2\u221a2, which is greater than \u2018K\u2019.So it can\u2019t be grouped together.So the groups are [(0,0) , (1,1)] , [(3,3)].The number of groups is 2. Hence the answer is 2.\n\nFor the second test case,\nThe distance between any pair of points is greater than \u2018K\u2019.So no points can be grouped together.So the groups are [(0,0)] , [(1,1)] , [(2,2)].
