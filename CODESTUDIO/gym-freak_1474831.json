He planned to bring some gym equipment to his home. Unfortunately, there is a lack of gym equipment in the shop. He could only bring adjustable dumbbells and an infinite number of weights of  &#39;A&#39; kgs and &#39;B&#39; kgs, respectively.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"his-friend-john-also-joined-him-in-the-workout-ninja-wanted-to-lift-a-dumbbell-of-k-kgs-by-combining-weights-of-a-kgs-and-b-kgs-he-can-choose-any-number-of-weights-of-a-kgs-or-b-kgs-possibly-0-each-being-interested-in-maths-john-challenged-him-to-find-the-total-number-of-different-ways-to-make-a-dumbbell-of-k-kgs-by-combining-weights-of-a-kgs-and-b-kgs\">His friend, John, also joined him in the workout. Ninja wanted to lift a dumbbell of &#39;K&#39; kgs by combining weights of &#39;A&#39; kgs and &#39;B&#39; kgs. He can choose any number of weights of &#39;A&#39; kgs or &#39;B&#39; kgs, possibly 0 each. Being interested in Maths, John challenged him to find the total number of different ways to make a dumbbell of &#39;K&#39; kgs by combining weights of &#39;A&#39; kgs and &#39;B&#39; kgs.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-is-not-proficient-in-maths-can-you-help-ninja-to-find-out-the-answer\">Ninja is not proficient in Maths. Can you help Ninja to find out the answer?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers, \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, and \u2018K\u2019, denoting the first weight that he bought, the second weight that he bought, and the weight he wants to lift, respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the number of ways in which Ninja can lift the dumbbell of K kgs by a combination of A and B kg weights.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n\nTwo ways are considered different if the number of times a is used or the number of times b is used is different in the two ways.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1&lt;= T &lt;= 10^4\n1 &lt;= A, B &lt;= 10^9\n0 &lt;= K &lt;= 10^9\n\nWhere \u2019T\u2019 is the number of test cases, &#39;A&#39; is the first weight that Ninja bought, \u2018B\u2019 is the second weight that Ninja bought, and \u2018K\u2019 is the weight Ninja wants to lift respectively.\n\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2 3 5\n2 3 12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the weights that Ninja bought are 2 and 3 kgs. The weight that he wants to lift is 5 kgs. There is only one way to make the combination of 5 kgs using both weights by choosing one weight of each type. So, the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, the weights that Ninja bought are 2 and 3 kgs. The weight that he wants to lift is 12 kgs. There are three ways to make the combination of 12 kgs. The first way is to take 6 weights of 2 kgs each, the second way is to take 4 weights of 3 kgs, and the last way is to take two weights of 3 kgs each and three weights of 2 kgs each. So, the answer is 3. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 5 10\n3 4 12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2\n</code></pre>\n",
