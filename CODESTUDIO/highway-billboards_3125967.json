All the possible sites to place a billboard is given in the \u2018billboards\u2019 array. The revenue earned by placing a billboard is described by the \u2018revenue\u2019 array, billboard at \u2018billboard[i]\u2019 will earn the revenue equal to \u2018revenue[i]\u2019. There is a condition that no two billboards can be placed within \u2018X\u2019 kilometres of each other.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given billboards = [2, 8, 9, 10, 15], revenue = [20, 50, 10, 30, 5], \u2018M\u2019 = \u201820\u2019, \u2018X\u2019 = 5, here we can place the billboard at positions 2, 8, 15, which will give the profit as 20 + 50 + 5 = 75. Hence the answer is 75.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019, representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains 3 space-separated integers \u2018M\u2019, \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018X\u2019, where \u2018N\u2019 is the number of billboards positions available, \u2018M\u2019 is the length of the highway, and \u2018X\u2019 is the minimum distance allowed between two billboards, respectively.\n\nThe second line of input contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers, describing the \u2018billboards\u2019 array.\n\nThe third line of input contains the \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers, describing the \u2018revenue\u2019 array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer representing the maximum profit earned.\n\nPrint a separate line for each test case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= X &lt;= M\n1 &lt;= billboards[i] &lt;= M\n1 &lt;= |revenue[i]| &lt;= 10^9\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
