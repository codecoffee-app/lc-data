There are a total of \u2018N\u2019 different dishes, numbered \u20180 to N-1\u2019. But there is a restriction. The ninja cannot make orders on his own will. There are \u2018M\u2019 types of orders that he can make. Each Order \u2018i\u2019 consists of three values represented by array \u2018C\u2019, \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, which means Ninja can order all dishes numbered \u2018L\u2019 to \u2018R\u2019 with the cost of \u2018C\u2019 Ninja currency.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-wants-to-taste-all-n-dishes-but-he-wants-to-spend-the-minimum-amount-of-ninja-currency\">Ninja wants to taste all \u2018N\u2019 dishes, but he wants to spend the minimum amount of Ninja Currency.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"can-you-help-ninja-figure-out-the-minimum-amount-of-ninja-currency-he-needs-to-spend-to-taste-all-dishes\">Can you help Ninja figure out the minimum amount of Ninja Currency he needs to spend to taste all dishes.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-can-assume-that-for-given-constraints-answers-always-exist\">You can assume that for given constraints, answers always exist.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>N = 4\nM = 3\nA = [ [ 0, 2, 1 ] , [ 1, 2, 4 ] , [ 2, 3, 3 ] ]\n\nIf Ninja chooses [ 0, 2, 1 ] and [ 2, 3, 3 ], he can taste each dish for 4 Ninja Currency.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases.\nThen the test cases follow:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, &#39;N&#39; and &#39;M&#39;, denoting the total number of dishes and the total number of different orders.\n\nThe following \u2018M\u2019 line contains three integers \u2018Li\u2019, \u2018Ri\u2019 and \u2018Ci\u2019, denoting Starting point of food, End Point of food and Cost of ordering from \u2018Li\u2019 to \u2018Ri\u2019. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Print an integer denoting the minimum Ninja Currency required to taste all dishes for each test case.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a new line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output.
