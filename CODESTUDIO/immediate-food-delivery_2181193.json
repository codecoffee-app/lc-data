It is guaranteed that a customer has exactly one first order.\n\nWrite an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe query result format is in the following example:\n\nDelivery table:\n+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+\n| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |\n+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+\n| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |\n| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |\n| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |\n| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |\n| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |\n| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |\n| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |\n+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+\n\nResult table:\n+----------------------+\n| immediate_percentage |\n+----------------------+\n| 50.00                |\n+----------------------+\nThe customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.\nThe customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.\nThe customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.\nThe customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.\nHence, half the customers have immediate first orders.\n</code></pre>\n",
