All the stacks have the same maximum capacity.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-supposed-to-implement-the-platesstack-class-that-can-perform-the-following-operations-efficiently\">You are supposed to implement the PlatesStack class that can perform the following operations efficiently:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>PlatesStack(int N) - Constructor to initialize the object where N denotes the maximum capacity of each stack.\n\npush(int value) - This function inserts the integer &quot;value&quot; in the leftmost stack which is not filled up to the maximum capacity.  \n\npop() - This function returns the value at the top of the rightmost stack which is not empty and removes it from that stack or returns -1 if all the stacks are empty.\n\npopAtStack(int index) - This function returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index and removes it from that stack and returns -1 if that stack is empty.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-answer-multiple-queries-each-query-will-correspond-to-one-of-the-above-mentioned-operations\">You have to answer multiple queries, each query will correspond to one of the above-mentioned operations.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>TYPE 1 corresponds to the push operation.\nTYPE 2 corresponds to the pop operation.\nTYPE 3 corresponds to the popAtStack operation.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the maximum capacity of the stacks.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries to be answered.\n\nThe next Q lines contain two integers TYPE and X separated by a single space. The integer TYPE denotes the type of the query and X denotes the value or the index of the stack on which the operation is to be performed.\nFor TYPE-2 query, value of X is always -1. You can ignore this integer. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each query of type 2 print the value at the top of the rightmost stack or print -1 if all the stacks are empty.\nFor each query of type 3 print the value at the top of the stack with the given index or print -1 if the stack at the given index is empty. \n\nPrint the answer for query in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
