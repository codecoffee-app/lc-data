The class should also have a `printCarInfo` method to print the car's number of gears and color.  Create another class, `RaceCar`, which inherits from the `Car` class.  `RaceCar` should have an additional attribute, `maxSpeed`, and a `printRaceCarInfo` method that prints the number of gears, color, and maximum speed. Implement the `Car` and `RaceCar` classes and within the `main` function, instantiate a `RaceCar` object using user provided inputs, then call `printRaceCarInfo` to output the `RaceCar`'s information to standard output.",
