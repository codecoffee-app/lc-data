Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.\nThe same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.\n\nThere are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.\nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.\nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\nThen the test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, the only line of output prints the corresponding roman numeral for the given integer \u2018N\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
