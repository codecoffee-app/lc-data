She plans to do internships in the summer and has prepared a list of \u2018N\u2019 companies. For each i-th company, the minimum experience needed is \u2018minExp[i]\u2019 days, and after completing the internship, she gains \u2018expGained[i]\u2019 days of experience. She is already having \u2018D\u2019 days of experience. As she is available only in summers, she can complete at most \u2018K\u2019 internships.
