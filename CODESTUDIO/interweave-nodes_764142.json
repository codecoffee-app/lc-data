Your task is to modify them by interweaving alternate nodes of the two linked lists. If one list is smaller than the other, complete the process using another linked list.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of Test cases.\nThe next &#39;2*T&#39; lines denote the &#39;T&#39; test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the first linked list separated by space and terminated by -1.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a second linked list separated by space and terminated by -1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print two lines denoting a single space-separated modified linked list by interweaving alternate nodes of the two linked lists.\n\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\nThe return type is a vector/list of Node*, hence you need to push the head of the first and then second modified linked lists and return the vector/list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10        \n0 &lt;= N1 &lt;= 10^4\n0 &lt;= N2 &lt;= 10^4\n-10^9 &lt;= data &lt;= 10^9 and data != -1\n\nTime Limit : 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n1 2 3 4 5 -1\n6 7 8 9 10 -1\n-1\n3 4 5 7 -1\n5 4 3 7 9 -1\n4 3 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 7 3 9 5 \n6 2 8 4 10\n4 7 \n3 5\n5 3 3 9 \n4 4 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input1\">Explanation For Sample Input1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Here we have 3 test cases, hence there are 3 pairs of linked lists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/t1-5088.png\" alt=\"Test case 1\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 1: Here we connect alternate nodes of linked list 1 and linked list 2. The yellow link in the above diagram shows the modified linking of linked list 1, similarly, the green link shows the modified linking of linked list 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/t2-5089.png\" alt=\"Test case 2\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 2: As the first linked list is of length zero, we need to use the second linked list for the process. Hence first two alternate nodes of linked list 2 would be modified linked list 2 and the remaining alternate nodes would become modified linked list 1. The yellow link in the above diagram shows the modified linking of linked list 1, similarly, the green link shows the modified linking of linked list 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/t3-5090.png\" alt=\"Test case 3\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 3: Here the linked list 2 is shorter than linked list 1, hence once we encounter NULL in linked list 2, we would use alternate nodes of linked list 1. The yellow link in the above diagram shows the modified linking of linked list 1, similarly, the green link shows the modified linking of linked list 2.\n</code></pre>\n",
