            "content": "<pre><code>Write a query to print the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (TIV_2016), to a scale of 2 decimal places, for all policy holders who meet the following criteria:\n\nHave the same TIV_2015 value as one or more other policyholders.\nAre not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude, longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).\nInput Format:\nThe insurance table is described as follows:\n\n| Column Name | Type          |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| PID         | INTEGER(11)   |\n| TIV_2015    | NUMERIC(15,2) |\n| TIV_2016    | NUMERIC(15,2) |\n| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |\n| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |\nwhere PID is the policyholder&#39;s policy ID, TIV_2015 is the total investment value in 2015, TIV_2016 is the total investment value in 2016, LAT is the latitude of the policy holder&#39;s city, and LON is the longitude of the policy holder&#39;s city.\n\nSample Input\n\n| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |\n|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|\n| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |\n| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |\n| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |\n| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |\nSample Output\n\n| TIV_2016 |\n|----------|\n| 45.00    |\nExplanation\n\nThe first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.\nThe TIV_2015 value &#39;10&#39; is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.\n\nThe second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.\n\nAnd its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.\n\nSo, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.\n</code></pre>\n",
