Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.\n\nAnd its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.\n\nSo, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.\n</code></pre>\n",

Policyholder 4 also meets the criteria: TIV_2015 (10) is shared with policyholders 1 and 3, and the location (40, 40) is unique. Policyholder 2 fails the first condition since no other policyholder shares the same TIV_2015 value. Policyholder 3 fails the second condition since Policyholder 2 shares the same location.
