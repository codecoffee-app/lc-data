His coach assesses his progress by requesting the average number of hits within specific day ranges. As Jasprit's friend, you're tasked with creating a tool to help him manage his data. This tool should support two types of operations: adding daily hit counts to his record and calculating the average hit count for a given date range.\n\nGiven an initial array 'ARR' representing the stump hits for 'N' days, and a series of 'Q' queries, implement a solution to process these queries.\n\n**Query Types:**\n\n1.  **Add Hits:** Append a new daily hit count 'X' to the end of the 'ARR'.\n2.  **Calculate Average:** Determine the average stump hits for the days within the inclusive range '[L, R]'. The average is calculated by summing the hits in the specified range and dividing by the number of days in the range. The result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The 'ARR' uses 0-based indexing.\n*   Queries of type 2 use 1-based indexing.\n*   Ensure the average is rounded down to the nearest integer.",
