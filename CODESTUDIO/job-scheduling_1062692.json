Each job can be characterized by three parameters-</h4>\n\n<pre><code>\u2022 Start Time, denoting the start time of the job.\n\u2022 End Time, denoting the end time of the job.\n\u2022 Profit associated with the job.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-required-to-schedule-the-jobs-in-such-a-way-that-total-profit-will-be-maximized\">You are required to schedule the jobs in such a way that total profit will be maximized.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-only-one-job-can-be-scheduled-at-a-time-and-jobs-can-be-scheduled-at-only-integer-moments-of-time-greater-than-or-equal-to-one\">Note: Only one job can be scheduled at a time, and jobs can be scheduled at only integer moments of time greater than or equal to one.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example-</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let there be three jobs \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, and \u2018C\u2019-\n\u2022 Start time, End time and profit associated with job \u2018A\u2019 being 1, 1 and 30.\n\u2022 Start time, End time and profit associated with job \u2018B\u2019 being 1, 2 and 40.\n\u2022 Start time, End time and profit associated with job \u2018C\u2019 being 3, 4 and 30.\n\nWe will perform job \u2018B\u2019 at time t = 1 and job \u2018C\u2019 at time t = 3. The total profit will be 70. There is no other sequence of jobs which can fetch us a better overall profit. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run. Then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019, denoting the total number of jobes\n\nThe next \u2018N\u2019 lines contain three space separated integers, start[i], end[i] and profit[i] denoting the start time, end time and the profit associated with the i-th job.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the maximum profit after scheduling all the jobs in an optimal manner.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a new line. \n\nNote: You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
