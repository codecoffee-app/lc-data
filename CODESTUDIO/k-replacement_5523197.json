He still sometimes gets confused between normal numbers and prime numbers. So his teacher thought of giving him a fun game that can help him to get confident in this topic.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-game-was-there-is-string-str-of-length-n-which-includes-alphabets-and-digits-there-is-also-a-special-character-k-the-game-was-to-replace-every-prime-number-that-occurred-in-the-string-str-with-k\">The game was, there is string \u2018STR\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019 which includes alphabets and digits. There is also a special character \u2018K\u2019. The game was to replace every prime number that occurred in the string \u2018STR\u2019 with \u2018K\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"bob-has-solved-the-task-and-finished-the-game-but-he-still-has-doubt-that-the-final-string-he-got-after-the-replacement-is-correct-so-being-his-friend-he-asked-you-to-help-him-with-it\">Bob has solved the task and finished the game, but he still has doubt that the final string he got after the replacement is correct. So being his friend he asked you to help him with it.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"so-your-task-is-to-play-the-same-game-and-return-the-correct-final-string-after-replacement\">So your task is to play the same game and return the correct final string after replacement.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-1-is-neither-prime-nor-composite\">NOTE: 1 is neither prime nor composite.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">EXAMPLE :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: \u2018N\u2019 = 8, &#39;K&#39; = ?, \u2018STR\u2019 = A12a3CbB\n\nOutput: A1?a?CbB\nIn this case, the numbers are \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, and \u20183\u2019 at \u20182nd\u2019, \u20183rd\u2019, and \u20185th\u2019 positions respectively (1-based indexing). But only \u20182\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 are prime numbers, So after replacing them with \u2018K\u2019 the final string will be \u201cA1?a?CbB\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line will contain the integer \u2018T\u2019, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of input contains one integer and one character, \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 separated by spaces.\n\nFollowed by a line containing the string \u2018STR\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the correct final string after replacement.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything.
