The division will be {4, 5} and {2, 3, 4} with sum 9.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Every element of the array must occupy only one subset.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of the test case. Then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 representing the size of the array and \u2018K\u2019.\n\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers that represent elements of the array ARR.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return true if it is possible to divide &quot;ARR&quot; into &#39;K&#39; subsets of equal sum, false otherwise. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
