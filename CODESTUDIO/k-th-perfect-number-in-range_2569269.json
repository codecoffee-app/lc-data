A special number is a number that has (101)<sub>2</sub> subarray in its binary representation. You have a simple task, you need to find the \u2018K\u2019th\u2019 special number that lies in the given range, print -1 if it is not possible.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If L = 5 and R = 7, and you need to find the 1\u2019st special number lying in the range [5, 7]\n\nThe answer for this is equal to 5, as 5 is the first special number lying in the given range, it is a special number because it has a subarray 101 in its binary representation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \u2018L\u2019, \u2018R\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 denoting the range and the lucky number to be calculated respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the K\u2019th special number lying in the given range.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
