The snipers are numbered from 0 to N-1. However, some snipers are being defended by other snipers, and they can not be killed directly. For example, if sniper A is being defended by sniper B, Ninja has to kill sniper B first, and then only he can kill sniper A.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"so-you-are-given-a-defense-array-where-each-element-contains-two-integers-say-a-b-which-means-sniper-b-is-defended-by-sniper-a-your-task-is-to-find-out-the-minimum-time-needed-to-kill-each-sniper\">So, you are given a \u201cdefense\u201d array, where each element contains two integers, say A, B, which means sniper B is defended by sniper A. Your task is to find out the minimum time needed to kill each sniper.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If multiple snipers are defending a single sniper, then to kill this sniper, Ninja has to kill all its defenders first.\n\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible to kill all the snipers. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If N = 3 and defense = {{2,1}, {2,0}}.\n\nThere are three snipers, and the sniper 1 and 0 both are defended by sniper 2. So, Ninja can kill sniper two first, which takes 1 unit of time. Then he can kill the rest two snipers in any order. \n\nIf he kills the 1st sniper first and then the 0th sniper, then the time needed to kill each sniper will be {3, 2, 1}. If he kills the 0th sniper first and then the 1st sniper, then the time will be {2, 3, 1}. So, considering both the cases, the minimum time needed to kill the 0th sniper is 2. The minimum time needed to kill the 1st sniper is also 2, and the minimum time needed to kill the 2nd sniper is 1. So, the final answer is {2, 2, 1}.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T&#39;, which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, denoting the total number of snipers and the number of elements in the array \u201cdefense\u201d.\n\nThen M lines follow. Each line contains two space-separated integers denoting the sniper who is being defended and the sniper who is defending.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print N space-separated integers. Each integer denotes the minimum time needed to kill i-th sniper.  \n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
