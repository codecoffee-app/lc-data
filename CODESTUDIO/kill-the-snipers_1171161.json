The snipers are numbered from 0 to N-1. However, some snipers are being defended by other snipers which in turn may be defended by some other snipers, and they can not be killed directly. For example, if sniper A is being defended by sniper B, then Ninja has to kill sniper B first, and then only he can kill sniper A.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"so-you-are-given-a-defense-array-where-each-element-contains-two-integers-say-a-b-which-means-sniper-b-is-defended-by-sniper-a-your-task-is-to-find-out-whether-ninja-can-win-this-game-by-killing-all-the-snipers-or-not\">So, you are given a \u201cdefense\u201d array, where each element contains two integers, say A, B, which means sniper B is defended by sniper A. Your task is to find out whether Ninja can win this game by killing all the snipers or not.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If N = 3 and defense = {{2,1}, {2,0}}.\nThere are a total of three snipers, and the sniper 1 and 0 both are defended by sniper 2. So, Ninja can kill sniper 2 first, and then he can kill the rest two snipers in any order. Hence, the answer is YES, as Ninja can kill all the snipers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T&#39;, which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, denoting the total number of snipers and the number of elements in the array \u201cdefense\u201d.\n\nThen M lines follow. Each line contains two space-separated integers denoting the sniper defending and the sniper defended\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u201cYES\u201d, if Ninja can kill all the snipers. Print \u201cNO\u201d otherwise. \n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000\n1 &lt;= M &lt;= 5000\n0 &lt;= defense[i][0], defense[i][1] &lt;= N-1\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 3\n1 2\n0 3\n2 3\n3 3\n0 1\n1 2\n2 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>YES\nNO\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, the defense diagram is shown in the below figure.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/killthesnipers_input1_ex1-8008.png\" alt=\"graph_input1_ex1\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>One possible way to win the fight is to kill the snipers in the order 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.
