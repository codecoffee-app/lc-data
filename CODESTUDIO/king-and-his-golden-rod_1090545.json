He decides to distribute segments of his Golden Rod of length &quot;LEN&quot; among his subjects.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-golden-rod-can-be-cut-into-segments-using-only-3-special-scales-scalea-scaleb-and-scalec-respectively-these-scales-are-called-special-because-the-cut-length-of-the-golden-rod-can-either-be-scalea-scaleb-or-scalec\">The Golden Rod can be cut into segments using only 3 special scales: &quot;scaleA&quot;, &quot;scaleB&quot; and &quot;scaleC&quot;, respectively. These scales are called special because the cut length of the Golden Rod can either be &quot;scaleA&quot;, &quot;scaleB&quot; or &quot;scaleC&quot;.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the length of the Golden Rod i.e &quot;LEN&quot; is 5 and &quot;scaleA&quot; is 1, &quot;scaleB&quot; is 2, and &quot;scaleC&quot; is 3; then the different ways to cut Golden Rod into segments are:\n\nFive segments each of length 1 i.e [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nOne segment of length 2 and three segments each of length 1 i.e. [2, 1, 1, 1].\nOne segment of length 1 and two segments each of length 2 i.e. [1, 2, 2].\nOne segment of length 3 and two segments each of length 1 i.e. [3, 1, 1].\nOne segment of length 3 and one segment of length 2 i.e. [3, 2]. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"akbar-wants-to-distribute-his-golden-rod-among-maximum-possible-subjects-so-he-calls-birbal-for-help\">Akbar wants to distribute his Golden Rod among maximum possible subjects.
