You have to find the \u2018K\u2019-th factor of \u2018N\u2019, where the \u2018K\u2019-th factor is the \u2018K\u2019-th number in a sequence of all the factors of \u2018N\u2019 arranged in ascending order.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If N = 12 and K = 5, then we have to find the 5\u2019th factor of 12 out of the list of all factors of 12 : [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 5\u2019th factor in the list is 6.

Then \u2018T\u2019 test cases follow:\n\nThe first and only line in each test case contains two space-separated positive integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, where &#39;N&#39; is the positive integer whose factor is to be found, \u2018K\u2019 is the \u2018K\u2019th number in a sequence of all the factors of \u2018N\u2019 arranged in ascending order.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the \u2018K\u2019th factor of the given positive integer \u2018N\u2019.

Hence, the output is 5.\n\nIn the second test case, \u2018N\u2019 is 11, so all the factors of 11 are : [1, 11], \u2018K\u2019 given is 4, but only 2 factors exist.

Hence, the output is 2.\n\nIn the second test case, \u2018N\u2019 is 13, so all the factors of 13 are : [1, 13], \u2018K\u2019 given is 2, so we have to find the 2\u2019nd factor of 13, which is 13.
