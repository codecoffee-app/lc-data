He wants to meet his friends. He has total \u2018n\u2019 friends, and everyone is not available on the same day. But he can meet his friends only once. Given two arrays, \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019, where s[i] denotes the starting date when an ith friend is available, and e[i] denotes when the ith friend will not be available after this date. Help Kurapika to know what is the maximum number of friends he can meet on one single day.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>s = {1, 4, 11} e = {9, 5, 13}\n\nIn the given example, the first friend is available between dates 1 to 9, the second is available on dates 4 and 5, and the third is available on dates 11 to 13. Hence he can meet a maximum of only two friends on dates 4 and 5.\n\nHence the answer is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the total number of friends.\n\nThe second line of the test case denotes an array of \u2018N\u2019 integers \u2018s\u2019 denoting the starting date when the ith friend will be available.\n\nThe third line of the test case denotes an array of \u2018N\u2019 integers \u2018e\u2019 denoting the ending date when the ith friend will be available.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer \u201canswer\u201d, denoting the maximum number of friends he can meet.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
