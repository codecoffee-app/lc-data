Your task is to find the largest number, \u2018K\u2019, such that both the values \u2018K\u2019 and -\u2018K\u2019 are present in the given array &#39;arr&#39;.

Hence, the answer is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code> For each test case, print the largest number, \u2018K\u2019, such that -\u2019K\u2019 is also present in the array.\n\nThe output for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

Hence, the answer is 3.\n\nFor test case 2 :\nWe cannot take any number as there does not exist any number following the given condition.
