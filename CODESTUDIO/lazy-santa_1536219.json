There are \u2018N\u2019 children in the park who are standing in a straight line, and not crowding up due to COVID restrictions. You are given an array \u201cdistance\u201d containing \u2018N\u2019 integers where \u201cdistance[i]\u201d denotes the distance of the ith child from the gate of the park in meters. Each child stands at a different distance from the gate.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"since-santa-is-still-on-his-reindeer-he-can-land-at-any-position-in-the-park-but-once-he-lands-on-the-ground-he-uses-his-feet-to-walk-santa-is-very-lazy-and-is-requesting-you-to-find-the-minimum-distance-he-needs-to-travel-on-his-feet-so-that-he-can-distribute-all-the-k-gifts-to-k-different-children\">Since Santa is still on his reindeer, he can land at any position in the park. But once he lands on the ground, he uses his feet to walk. Santa is very lazy and is requesting you to find the minimum distance he needs to travel on his feet so that he can distribute all the \u2018K\u2019 gifts to \u2018K\u2019 different children.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let there be 6 children and 3 gifts. If the position of the children is [3, 6, 7, 10, 17, 25], the minimum distance Santa has to walk is 4m which can be achieved in many ways, one of them being Santa landing at the 1st child and walking till the 3rd child (distance = (6m - 3m) + (7m - 6m) = 4m).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run. Then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 denoting the number of children and number of gifts respectively.\n\nThe next line contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the array \u201cdistance\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return an integer denoting the minimum distance Santa has to travel.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a new line. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
