The statistics should be built using the played matches where the winning team gets three points and the losing team gets no points. If a match ends with a draw, both teams get one point.\n\nEach row of the result table should contain:\n\nteam_name - The name of the team in the Teams table.\nmatches_played - The number of matches played as either a home or away team.\npoints - The total points the team has so far.\ngoal_for - The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.\ngoal_against - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against this team across all matches.\ngoal_diff - The result of goal_for - goal_against.\nReturn the result table in descending order by points. If two or more teams have the same points, order them in descending order by goal_diff. If there is still a tie, order them by team_name in lexicographical order.\n\nThe query result format is in the following example:\n\n\n\nTeams table:\n+---------+-----------+\n| team_id | team_name |\n+---------+-----------+\n| 1       | Ajax      |\n| 4       | Dortmund  |\n| 6       | Arsenal   |\n+---------+-----------+\n\nMatches table:\n+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |\n+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |\n| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |\n| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |\n| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |\n+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n\n\nResult table:\n+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+\n| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |\n+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+\n| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |\n| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |\n| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |\n+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+\n\nAjax (team_id=1) played 4 matches: 2 losses and 2 draws. Total points = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.\nDortmund (team_id=4) played 2 matches: 2 wins. Total points = 3 + 3 = 6.\nArsenal (team_id=6) played 2 matches: 2 draws.
