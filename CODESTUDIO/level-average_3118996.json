For each level of the binary tree, find the floor value of the average of every node in the tree.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the given binary tree: [1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 4, 5, -1, -1, -1, -1]\nStart Node: 3\n\n    1\n   / \\\n 2   3\n      / \\\n     4  5\n\nThe answer should be [1,2,4] because level 1 has an average of 1(AVERAGE of 1), level 2 has an average of 2 (floor value) (AVERAGE of 2 and 3) and level 2 has an average of 4 (floor value) (AVERAGE of 4 and 5). \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains elements of the tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/tree-13663.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>For example, the input for the tree depicted in the above image would be :</p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. \nHence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u2018H\u2019 integers denoting the average value of all the nodes for a particular level where &#39;H&#39; is the height of the tree given.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= N (Number of Nodes) &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= VALUE of the nodes &lt;= 10^9\n\nTime Limit = 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1 2 3 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 -1 -1\n1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 2 4\n1 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the tree looks like this:- \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/tree1-13664.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>So, the levels have an average value of 1, 2, and 4.\n\nIn the second test case, the tree looks like this:- \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/tree2-13665.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code> So, the levels have an average value of 1 and 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n3 1 2 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3 1\n</code></pre>\n",
