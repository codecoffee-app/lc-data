            "<p>If you observe carefully, you will notice that the very first integer in the sorted lexicographical order will be \u20181\u2019. We will now work on all the numbers that can come after 1 i.e 10, 100,1000 and so on. The basic idea is to divide the problem into subproblems and let recursion come into play. We know that the single-digit prefix for any number that can be part of the output can be from 1 to 9. Thus, we can fix the very first digit (single-digit prefix) say PRE, and make a recursive call to find all the numbers less than equal to N having their prefix PRE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
