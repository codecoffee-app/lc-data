When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting the new item.\n\n2. get(U__ID): Return the value of the key(\u2018U__ID\u2019),  present in the cache, if it\u2019s present otherwise return -1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>  1) The frequency of use of an element is calculated by a number of operations with its \u2018U_ID\u2019 performed after it is inserted in the cache.\n\n  2) If multiple elements have the least frequency then we remove the element which was least recently used. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-been-given-m-operations-which-you-need-to-perform-in-the-cache-your-task-is-to-implement-all-the-functions-of-the-lfu-cache\">You have been given \u2018M\u2019 operations which you need to perform in the cache. Your task is to implement all the functions of the LFU cache.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Type 1: for put(key, value) operation.\nType 2: for get(key) operation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>We perform the following operations on an empty cache which has capacity 2:\n\nWhen operation 1 2 3 is performed, the element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 2 and value 3 is inserted in the cache.\n\nWhen operation 1 2 1 is performed, the element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 2\u2019s value is updated to 1.  \n\nWhen operation 2 2 is performed then the value of &#39;U_ID&#39; 2 is returned i.e. 1.\n\nWhen operation 2 1 is performed then the value of &#39;U_ID&#39; 1 is to be returned but it is not present in cache therefore -1 is returned.\n\nWhen operation 1 1 5 is performed, the element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 1 and value 5 is inserted in the cache. \n\nWhen operation 1 6 4 is performed, the cache is full so we need to delete an element. First, we check the number of times each element is used. Element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 2 is used 3 times (2 times operation of type 1 and 1-time operation of type 1). Element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 1 is used 1 time (1-time operation of type 1). So element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 1 is deleted. The element with &#39;U_ID&#39; 6 and value 4 is inserted in the cache. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-se[arated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 representing the size of cache and number of operations respectively.\n\nNext \u2018M\u2019 lines contain operations that have to be performed on the cache.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a vector/list that contains answers of all the operations of type 2 and in the order in which they were asked.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1.
