For example, here if we perform one more shift, then we get the string \u201csoon\u201d which was the original string.)\nSo after two left shifts, we get the longest common prefix i.e. \u201con\u201d. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nFor the second test case, the common prefix of A and B is \u201can\u201d.\nAfter one left shift, the string B becomes \u201cna\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\nSo we get the longest common prefix without performing any shifts.

So we get the longest common prefix without performing any shifts. Hence, the answer is 0.\nFor the second test case, the common prefix of A and B is \u201c\u201d.\nAfter one left shift, the string B becomes \u201cersonalp\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\nAfter two left shifts, the string B becomes \u201crsonalpe\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\nAfter three left shifts, the string B becomes \u201csonalper\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201cso\u201d.\nAfter four left shifts, the string B becomes \u201conalpers\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\nAfter five left shifts, the string B becomes \u201cnalperso\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\nAfter six left shifts, the string B becomes \u201calperson\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\nAfter seven left shifts, the string B becomes \u201clpersona\u201d, now the common prefix is \u201c\u201d.\n\nSo after three left shifts, we get the longest common prefix i.e. \u201cso\u201d.
