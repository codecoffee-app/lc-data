To qualify for the regional contest, you have to solve at least one problem of the competition. The easiest problem among them is that you have given a string \u2018STR\u2019 containing digits, and you have to find the longest substring of length 2P such that the sum of right \u2018P\u2019 elements and left \u2018P\u2019 elements are equal.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line in each test contains the string \u2018STR\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer representing the length of the longest substring.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
