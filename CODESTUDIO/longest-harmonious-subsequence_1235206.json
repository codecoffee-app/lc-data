So, the difference between the maximum and the minimum = 4 - 3 = 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, which denotes the number of integers in the array \u2018ARR\u2019.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; integers of the array \u2018ARR\u2019, separated by space.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the size of the longest harmonious subsequence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of.

If we take the complete array, then the maximum of all the elements is 2 and the minimum of all the elements is 1. So, the difference between the maximum and the minimum = 2 - 1 = 1. Hence, the longest Harmonic subsequence is [1, 2, 2, 1] and its length is 4.\n\nIn the second test case, the given array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. If we take the complete array, then the maximum of all the elements is 4 and the minimum of all the elements is 1. \nSo, the difference between the maximum and the minimum = 4 - 1 = 3. So, it is not a Harmonic subsequence. If we take subsequence as [1, 2], then the maximum of all the elements is 2 and the minimum of all the elements is 1. \nSo, the difference between the maximum and the minimum = 2 - 1 = 1. So, it is a harmonic subsequence and this is the longest harmonic subsequence. If we take subsequence as [2, 3] or [3, 4], then we will get the same answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\n1 2\n10\n1 2 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n7\n</code></pre>\n",
