You are given a 2-dimensional array \u2018Edges\u2019 in which \u2018Edges[i][0]\u2019 and \u2018Edges[i][1]\u2019 contains an edge.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the example below, the longest path is between nodes 1 and 3. The length of the path is 3 since the number of edges between node 1 and node 3 is 3. Hence, the answer is 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000463_1625465199_image2.png\" alt=\"altImage\"></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nThe following \u2018N\u2019 - 1 line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, \u2018Edges[i][0]\u2019 and \u2018Edges[i][1]\u2019 representing an edge between the two nodes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, the length of the longest path in the tree. \n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of.
