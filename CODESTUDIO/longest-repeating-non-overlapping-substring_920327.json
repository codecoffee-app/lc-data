In other words, a string X is said to be a substring of the string S if X = S[a...b] = S[a]S[a+1]\u2026..S[b] and 0 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt;= len(S) (0-based indexing).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-can-return-any-such-substring-if-more-than-one-such-substring-exists-in-the-string-if-there-is-no-such-substring-return-1\">You can return any such substring if more than one such substring exists in the string. If there is no such substring, return -1.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. Repeating substrings in a string means those substrings which occur more than once in a string. For example, in the string \u201cabaaba\u201d, substrings \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, \u201cab\u201d, \u201cba\u201d, \u201caba\u201d are repeating.\n\n2. Two substrings are called Non-overlapping substrings, if the intersection of all the indices of first substring i.e. [L1, R1] where L1 and R1 are the starting and ending index of the first substring respectively, and indices of the second substring i.e. [L2, R2] where L2 and R2 are the starting and ending indices respectively of the second substring, is NULL.\n\n3. For example, in the string \u201cabaaba\u201d, two non-overlapping strings are \u201cab\u201d lying in the interval [0, 1] (0-based indexing) and \u201caba\u201d lying in the interval [3, 5] (0-based indexing). \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains the string str, whose longest repeating non-overlapping substring is to be found.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of output of each test case should contain a string representing the longest repeating non-overlapping substring of the input string or -1 if no such substring exists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
