You are also given a positive integer &#39;K&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-a-substring-of-this-string-is-good-if-it-contains-at-most-k-distinct-characters-a-string-x-is-a-substring-of-string-y-if-it-can-be-obtained-by-deletion-of-several-continuous-elements-possibly-zero-from-the-beginning-and-the-end-from-the-string-y\">Now, a substring of this string is good if it contains at most &#39;K&#39; distinct characters. A string &#39;X&#39; is a substring of string &#39;Y&#39; if it can be obtained by deletion of several continuous elements(possibly zero) from the beginning and the end from the string &#39;Y&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-return-the-maximum-size-of-any-good-substring-of-the-string-s\">Your task is to return the maximum size of any good substring of the string &#39;S&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018S\u2019 = \u201cbacda\u201d and \u2018K\u2019 = 3.\n\nSo, the substrings having at most \u20183\u2019 distinct characters are called good substrings. Some possible good substrings are:\n1. \u201cbac\u201d\n2. \u201cacd\u201d\n3. \u201cacda\u201d\n\nThe substring \u201cacda\u201d is the largest possible good substring, as we cannot get any other substring of length 5 or more having distinct characters less than or equal to \u20183\u2019. Thus, you should return \u20184\u2019 as the answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run. Then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018K\u2019, denoting the maximum number of distinct characters.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string \u2018S\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing an integer denoting the length of the longest substring that contains at most &#39;K&#39; distinct characters.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= 26\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^4\n\nAll the characters of the string are lowercase English alphabet letters.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\nabcbc\n1\nabccc\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case :\nK = 2, so we can choose substring \u201cbcbc\u201d having 2 distinct character which is less than or equal to K = 2. \n\nWe cannot get any other substring of length 5 or more having distinct characters less than or equal to 2. Thus, you should return \u20184\u2019 as the answer.\n\nFor the second test case :\nK = 1, so we can choose substring \u201cccc\u201d having only 1 distinct character which is less than or equal to K = 1. \n\nWe cannot get any other substring of length 4 or more having distinct characters less than or equal to 1. Thus, you should return \u20183\u2019 as the answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n6\nabcba\n3\nacbdab\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n4\n</code></pre>\n",
