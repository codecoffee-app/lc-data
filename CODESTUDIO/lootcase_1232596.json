But one day he was coming back from the office. He saw a car tumbling down the road. He goes near the car and he saw a man deeply wounded. Ninja tries to pull out the man from the car but the man says he is dying and asks Ninja to find out the solution of the quiz which is written on paper which can lead to him an address where he has put the suitcase full of money.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"so-the-quiz-is-two-numbers-were-written-on-the-paper-lets-assume-l-and-r-the-house-number-where-the-suitcase-has-been-hidden-is-that-digit-of-prime-number-which-can-occur-between-l-and-r-and-has-a-maximum-frequency\">So the quiz is two numbers were written on the paper let&#39;s assume \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019. The house number where the suitcase has been hidden is that digit of prime number which can occur between \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 and has a maximum frequency.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"help-our-ninja-to-find-that-digit-so-he-is-able-to-find-out-that-suitcase-full-of-money\">Help our Ninja to find that digit so he is able to find out that suitcase full of money.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-out-the-highest-occurring-digit-in-prime-number-which-lies-in-between-given-numbers-l-1-and-r-1-as-l-and-r-are-exclusive-if-two-numbers-have-the-same-frequency-return-the-largest-and-if-no-prime-number-exists-in-that-range-return-1\">Your task is to find out the highest occurring digit in prime number which lies in between given numbers \u2018L+1\u2019 and \u2018R-1\u2019 as &#39;L&#39; and &#39;R&#39; are exclusive. If two numbers have the same frequency return the largest and if no prime number exists in that range return  \u2018-1\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018L = 1\u2019 and  \u2018R = 15\u2019 so between these numbers prime numbers lie are - {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}. As you can see \u201811\u2019 has two \u20181s\u2019 and \u201813\u2019 has one \u20181\u2019 so the frequency of \u20181\u2019 is \u20183\u2019 which is maximum hence our answer is \u20181\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Both &#39;L&#39; and &#39;R&#39; are exclusive.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a \u2018T\u2019 number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 denoting the range.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the number with the highest frequency.

All numbers have the same frequency i.e. \u20181\u2019 of \u20182\u2019, \u20183\u2019, \u20185\u2019, \u20187\u2019 but \u20187\u2019 is the maximum element so our answer is \u20187\u2019.\n\nTest Case 2:\n\nFor this test case given range is \u201821\u2019 and \u201831\u2019. The prime numbers between this range are {23, 29}. \u20182\u2019 is the digit that has maximum frequency i.e. \u20182\u2019 so our answer is \u20182\u2019 (other digits \u20183\u2019 and \u20189\u2019 have only \u20181\u2019 frequency).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 9\n2 20\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>7\n1\n</code></pre>\n",
