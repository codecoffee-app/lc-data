Now, you have arranged N loud-speakers where the ith loudspeaker has loudness or amplitude LOUD[i]. Now when one loudspeaker of loudness Y is kept with another loudspeaker of loudness X, the combined loudness is expressed as Y^X.</h4>\n\n<p>So, when N loudspeakers are kept in order A1, A2, A3\u2026\u2026\u2026.An, the combined loudness will be (A1^(A2^(A3^(...........(An))))). \nSo, your task is to rearrange the loudspeakers such that the combined loudness emitted is maximum.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let, \nN = 3\nLOUD = [4, 5, 6]\nAnswer:- [4, 5, 6]\nExplanation:- The answer should be 4,5,6 because out of all the rearrangements that are possible the array [4,5,6] will emit the largest combined loudness. Arrangement 4,5,6 emits an amplitude of 4^5^6 (1152921504606846976) and arrangement 6,5,4 emits an amplitude of 6^5^4 (3656158440062976).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of loudspeakers you have.\n\nThe third line contains \u2018N\u2019 integers of the array \u2018LOUD\u2019 denoting the loudness of the speakers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u2018N\u2019 integers denoting the lexicographically smallest rearrangement of loudspeakers such that they emit the largest combined loudness.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= LOUD[i] &lt;= 10^9\n\nNote:- Loudspeakers having an amplitude of more than 1 will all have unique amplitudes.\n\nTime Limit = 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n2\n2 3\n2\n2 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3 2\n2 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the answer should be 3, 2 because 3, 2 emits a loudness of 9 which is the maximum possible.\nIn the second test case, the answer should be 2, 4 because 2, 4 emits a loudness of 16 which is the largest possible. (Note that 4, 2 also yields the same output but 2, 4 is lexicographically smaller).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n1\n7\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>7\n</code></pre>\n",

                "body": "You are tasked with arranging loudspeakers for a cultural festival to maximize the combined loudness. You have `N` loudspeakers, where the `i`th loudspeaker has loudness `LOUD[i]`. When two loudspeakers with loudness `Y` and `X` are combined, the resulting loudness is `Y^X` (Y to the power of X).  For `N` loudspeakers arranged as `A1, A2, A3, ..., An`, the total loudness is calculated as `(A1^(A2^(A3^(...^(An))))`.  Your goal is to rearrange the loudspeakers in a lexicographically smallest order that produces the maximum possible combined loudness.",
