This is because the first taxi (index 0, cost 1) can make seven trips costing a total of 7 minutes, the second taxi can make two trips costing 6 minutes, and the third taxi can make one trip costing 5 minutes. Hence, we can make a total of 10 trips in 7 minutes. \nHence, the answer to this test case will be 7.\nFor test case Two:\n\u2018X=3\u2019, \u2018N=3\u2019, and \u2018taxiTravelTime=[ 3, 4, 8]\u2019, then the answer is 6. This is because the first taxi (index 0, cost 3) can make two trips costing 6 minutes, and the second taxi can make one trip costing 4 minutes. Hence, we can make a total of 2 trips in 6 minutes. \nHence, the answer to this test case will be 6.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n15 4\n5 6 9 10\n6 2\n13 15 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>30\n45\n</code></pre>\n",
