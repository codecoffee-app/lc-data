In particular, he is interested in magical numbers. For a given array \u2018A\u2019 of size 10 (A[0], A[1], \u2026.., A[9]), he considers all the integers \u2018i\u2019 as magical if there exists some digit \u2018D\u2019 which occurs exactly A[D] times in the decimal representation of \u2018i\u2019 without leading zeros. Now given two integers \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, and array \u2018A\u2019. You are required to count the number of non-magical numbers in the range [L, R] both inclusive.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Range = [17, 25], A = [4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 7, 1, 5]\n\nMagical numbers in the given range are\n18, has 8 A[8] = 1 time.\n20, has 2 A[2] = 1 time.\n21, has 2 A[2] = 1 time.\n23, has 2 A[2] = 1 time.\n24, has 2 A[2] = 1 time.\n25, has 2 A[2] = 1 time.\nAll the remaining numbers in the range are non-magical, i.e., 17, 19, and 22.\nWe have three non-magical elements for \u2018A\u2019 in the given range. So the output will be 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the no. of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, denoting the range on which we have to count non-magical numbers.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains 10 space-separated integers, denoting the elements of \u2018A\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer value denoting the number of non-magical numbers for \u2018A\u2019 in the given range. \n\nPrint a separate line for each test case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
