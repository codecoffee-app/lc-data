So this time she gives Conan a simple problem to solve in which he is given a string &#39;S&#39; consisting of lowercase and uppercase characters.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"she-tells-him-that-a-magical-string-is-a-string-that-does-not-have-an-adjacent-pair-of-the-same-characters-with-one-character-being-lowercase-and-the-other-being-uppercase-formally-s-is-magical-if-there-exits-no-i-such-that-s-i-is-a-lowercase-character-and-s-i-1-is-the-same-character-but-in-uppercase-or-vice-versa\">She tells him that a &quot;Magical String&quot; is a string that does not have an adjacent pair of the same characters with one character being lowercase and the other being uppercase. Formally, &#39;S&#39; is magical if there exits no &#39;i&#39; such that &#39;S[i]&#39; is a lowercase character and &#39;S[ i + 1]&#39; is the same character but in uppercase or vice-versa.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-conan-has-to-make-the-string-s-magical-by-removing-the-minimum-number-of-characters-and-return-hibara-the-magical-string-hence-made\">Now, Conan has to make the string &#39;S&#39; magical by removing the minimum number of characters and return Hibara the magical string hence made.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-help-conan-to-obtain-the-magical-string\">Your task is to help Conan to obtain the magical string.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>An empty string is also magical.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe next \u2018T\u2019 lines contain a string \u2018S\u2019 given by Haibara.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the magical string \u2018S\u2019 by removing the minimum number of characters.\n\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50\n1 &lt;= |S| &lt;= 100\n\nWhere \u2018T\u2019 is the number of test cases and |S| is the length of the string \u2018S.\u2019\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nsweeEet\ncodeE\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>sweet\ncod\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, either you choose i = 3 or i = 4, both will have the same result \u201csweet\u201d.\n\nIn the second test case, there is only one option i.e i = 3. Hence the result will be \u201ccod\u201d\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nabBAcC\nninja\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>ninja\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, first of all, we will choose &#39;i&#39; =1, which will lead us to \u201caAcC\u201d. Now we have to choose &#39;i&#39; = 0, to remove \u201caA\u201d which will lead us to \u201ccC\u201d. Now we have to remove &#39;i&#39; = 0 again to make the string magical.\n\n\u201cabBAcC\u201d -&gt; \u201caAcC\u201d -&gt; \u201ccC\u201d -&gt; \u201c\u201d\n\nIn the second test, the given string is already magical.
