In one unit of time, you can choose any bag \u2018i\u2019 and eat all the chocolates \u2018A[i]\u2019 in that bag and then the magician fills the ith bag with floor(\u2018A[i]\u2019 / 2) chocolates. Your task is to find the maximum number of chocolate you can eat in \u2018K\u2019 units of time.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"since-the-answer-could-be-large-return-answer-modulo-10-9-7\">Since the answer could be large, return answer modulo 10^9 + 7.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the array [ 4, 7, 9, 10] and \u2018k\u2019=2\nIn the first step, we can choose the last bag. So the answer will be 10 and the array will be [4, 7, 9, 5].\nIn the second step, we can choose the second last bag. So the answer will be 19 and the array will be [4, 7, 4, 5].\nSo the final output will be 19.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, representing the number of bags and the amount of time.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers representing the number of chocolates in each bag.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer representing the maximum number of chocolates you can eat in the given amount of time.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= ARR[i] &lt;= 10^5\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \u2018N\u2019 over all test cases doesn\u2019t exceed 10^5.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 1\n3 8 2 4\n4 2\n10 4 7 22\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>8\n33\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation For Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case,\nIn the first step, we can choose the second bag. So the answer will be 8 and the array will be [3, 4, 2, 4].\nSo, the final answer will be 8.\n\nFor the second test case,\nIn the first step, we can choose the last bag. So the answer will be 22 and the array will be [10, 4, 7, 11].\nIn the second step, we can choose the last bag. So the answer will be 33 and the array will be [10, 4, 7, 5].\nSo, the final answer will be 33.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5 3\n3 6 10 12 8\n4 1\n2 10 4 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>30\n10\n</code></pre>\n",
