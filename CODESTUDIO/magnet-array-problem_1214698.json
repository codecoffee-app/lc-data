Each magnet experiences a repulsive force i.e magnets on the left repel to the right and magnets on the right repel to the left side. The force by which a magnet repels another magnet is equal to the reciprocal of the distance between them(1/d, where d is the distance between them).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-been-given-an-array-arr-denoting-the-positions-of-the-magnets-on-the-x-axis-your-task-is-to-find-all-the-equilibrium-points-on-the-x-axis\">You have been given an array \u201cARR\u201d denoting the positions of the magnets on the x-axis, your task is to find all the equilibrium points on the x-axis.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>An equilibrium point is a point where net force is 0 i.e repulsive force of left side magnets is equal to the repulsive force of right side magnets.\n\nIf there are N magnets, then there will be N - 1 equilibrium points.\n\nThe array \u201cARR\u201d which denotes the positions of the magnets is in a sorted fashion. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If ARR = {1, 3} , then the output will be 2.\n\nExplanation: For two points, the mid-point will have a net force of 0 because the distance from the mid-point will be equal.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.
