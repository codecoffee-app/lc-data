To prevent this, Major Francis Monogram wants to send mail to Perry the Platypus to inform him about the mischief. He just needs to send a secret message \u2018s\u2019 to perry. He has a special keyboard \u201ckeyboard\u201d in which all the letters are in a straight line but jumbled. The time taken to move his finger from index \u2018i\u2019 to index \u2018j\u2019 is |j - i|. He wants to know how much time will it take to send the secret message to Perry.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Initially, he is at the first letter of the keyboard.\n\nAll letters are in lower-case English letters. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let s = \u201cperry\u201d, keyboard = \u201cqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\u201d.\n\nNow In this example, Francis will start from the first index and go to \u2018p\u2019, which will take 9 seconds, now from \u2018p\u2019 to \u2018e\u2019, the distance is of 7 indexes, from \u2018e\u2019 to \u2018r\u2019 the distance is 1, from \u2018r\u2019 to \u2018r\u2019 it will be zero, and from \u2018r\u2019 to \u2018y\u2019 the distance will be 2. Hence the total time taken is 9 + 7 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 19.\nHence the answer is 19.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string \u201ckeyboard\u201d denoting the keyboard\u2019s layout.\n\nThe second line of the test case contains a string \u2018s\u2019 denoting the secret message which needs to be sent.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer \u201canswer\u201d, denoting the time taken by Francis to type the secret message.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

It is 9 + 5 + 1 +0 +1 = 16. Original Explanation's Calculation Error: Now In this example, Francis will start from the first index and go to \u2018p\u2019, which will take 9 seconds, now from \u2018p\u2019 to \u2018e\u2019, the distance is of 7 indexes, from \u2018e\u2019 to \u2018r\u2019 the distance is 1, from \u2018r\u2019 to \u2018r\u2019 it will be zero, and from \u2018r\u2019 to \u2018y\u2019 the distance will be 2. Hence the total time taken is 9 + 7 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 19. The distance between p and e is 5 rather than 7, and the distance between r and y is actually 1"
