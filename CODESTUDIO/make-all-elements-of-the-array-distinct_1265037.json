In one operation you can increase an element by 1. Your task is to return the minimum number of operations to make the array distinct.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let\u2019s say you have an array/list [1,4,4,5]. We can increase the third element by 1 and the fourth element by 1. Finally, our array will look like [1,4,5,6] where all elements are distinct. Therefore the minimum number of operations is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the size of the array/list \u2018ARR\u2019.\n\nThe second line and the last line of input contain \u2018N\u2019 single space-separated integers representing the array/list elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the minimum number of operations to make the array distinct. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

The array/list will become [3,2,4,5] where all elements are distinct.\n\nTherefore the answer is 2.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nWe can increase the second element twice and the fourth element once in the array/list. The array/list will become [7,3,1,2] where all elements are distinct.\n\nTherefore the answer is 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n1 2 6 4\n8\n1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n16\n</code></pre>\n",
