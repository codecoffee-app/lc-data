We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.\nSo print \u20181\u2019 as a length of the removed subarray [4].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases given. Then next \u2018T\u2019 lines follow:\n\nThe first line of each test case input contains two single space-separated integers, where the first integer &#39;N&#39; represents the number of the elements in the \u2018NUMS\u2019 array/list and the second integer is the value of \u2018P\u2019.\n\nThe next line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the elements of the \u2018NUMS\u2019 array/list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case, print the length of the smallest subarray (array/list) that you need to remove, or -1 if it&#39;s impossible.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
