The person who has the best pulse of the survey the firm will reward the population. The survey comprised of N questions was taken by M participants, not simultaneously but one after the other. There is no correct answer since it is a survey of brands. Each question can have only four options (1,2,3,4). Most expected answers to different questions are used as a template to measure brand popularity. Think of this as a default answer sheet where the question paper is the Survey. &#39;0&#39; represents no answer to a question. Thus it means that the participant has skipped answering that question.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"right-answer-for-a-particular-question-the-highly-chosen-option-till-that-point-in-time-is-treated-as-the-correct-answer-if-multiple-options-have-the-exact-count-then-out-of-those-options-the-one-which-was-chosen-recently-is-treated-as-the-correct-answer\">Right Answer: For a particular question, the highly chosen option till that point in time is treated as the correct answer.

The survey has N questions, and M participants answer them sequentially. There are no correct answers, as it's a survey about brands. Each question has four options (1, 2, 3, 4). A default answer sheet represents expected answers and is used to measure brand popularity. '0' indicates a skipped question.\n\nThe 'Right Answer' for a particular question is determined by the most frequently chosen option up to that point. In case of ties, the most recently chosen option is considered the correct answer.\n\nA participant's 'Score' is calculated by awarding one point for each correct answer. No points are deducted for wrong answers.\n\nThe 'Instant Result,' the number of correct answers, is shared with the participant immediately after completion.\n\nFinally, only the 'Final Result' - the highest scorer (Topper) - and their score are announced.\n\nAt the end of the survey, with all M participants completing the exam, the final correct answers are determined. The score of each candidate is recalculated based on these final answers, and the participant with the highest score is declared the Topper. In case of a tie, the participant who attempted the exam first wins.",
