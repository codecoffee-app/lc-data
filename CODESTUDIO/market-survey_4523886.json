The person who has the best pulse of the survey the firm will reward the population. The survey comprised of N questions was taken by M participants, not simultaneously but one after the other. There is no correct answer since it is a survey of brands. Each question can have only four options (1,2,3,4). Most expected answers to different questions are used as a template to measure brand popularity. Think of this as a default answer sheet where the question paper is the Survey. &#39;0&#39; represents no answer to a question. Thus it means that the participant has skipped answering that question.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"right-answer-for-a-particular-question-the-highly-chosen-option-till-that-point-in-time-is-treated-as-the-correct-answer-if-multiple-options-have-the-exact-count-then-out-of-those-options-the-one-which-was-chosen-recently-is-treated-as-the-correct-answer\">Right Answer: For a particular question, the highly chosen option till that point in time is treated as the correct answer.

M participants take the survey sequentially.  '0' indicates a skipped question.  The \"correct\" answer for each question evolves dynamically as more participants respond. The \"correct\" answer at any point is the most frequently chosen option up to that point. If multiple options are tied, the most recently chosen option is considered correct. Each participant receives an instant score equal to the number of their correct answers based on the evolving \"correct\" answers at the time they complete the survey. Finally, the topper is the participant with the highest score based on the final \"correct\" answers after all M participants have taken the survey. If there is a tie, the participant who took the survey first is the topper.
