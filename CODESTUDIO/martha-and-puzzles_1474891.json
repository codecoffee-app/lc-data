She loves solving high-level puzzles. She has a list of \u2018N\u2019 puzzles. Each puzzle has some difficulty level. There is a rule that one can only solve a puzzle with difficulty \u2018X\u2019 if she has already solved all the puzzles with difficulty less than \u2018X\u2019. She can\u2019t wait to get a puzzle having a difficulty level higher than the current puzzle.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-tell-martha-how-long-she-has-to-wait-to-get-a-puzzle-having-a-higher-difficulty-level-than-the-current-puzzle-if-there-is-no-puzzle-ahead-with-a-higher-difficulty-level-just-print-0\">Your task is to tell Martha how long she has to wait to get a puzzle having a higher difficulty level than the current puzzle.
