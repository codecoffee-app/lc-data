Initially, all bulbs are turned OFF. You are given a 2-D array \u2018BULB\u2019 of size \u2018M\u2019, where \u2018BULB[i]\u2019 = [\u2018ROW\u2019, \u2018COL\u2019] indicates that the bulb is turned ON at position [\u2018ROW\u2019, \u2018COL\u2019].

For each query, print \u20181\u2019 if the \u2018MAT[ROW][COL]\u2019 is illuminated, else print 0. After answering a query, you have to turn OFF the bulb at \u2018MAT[ROW][COL]\u2019 and its 8 adjacent bulbs if they exist.
