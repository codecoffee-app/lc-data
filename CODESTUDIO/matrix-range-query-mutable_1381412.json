You are also given Q queries. Your task is to Perform two types of query-</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1) Find the sum of the rectangular submatrix defined by the upper left corner and lower right corner for each query. The position of the upper left and lower right corner is given.\n\n2) Change the value of the element at a given position. Position and the new value of the cell are given. \n\nAll indexes are 0 based.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>GRID =[ [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 0] ]\nQ = 2\nUpdate element at (3,3) to 9 \nleft corner = (1, 1), right corner = (2, 2)\nsubmatrix=[ [5, 6],\n            [8, 9] ]   \nAnswer = 28\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run.

Each of the next &#39;N&#39; lines contains \u2018M\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the elements of the matrix GRID.\n\nThen \u2018Q\u2019 lines follow. Each of the lines contains the type of the query and the query.\n\nIf the TYPE = 1, then it contains four space-separated integers \u2018X1\u2019, \u2018Y1\u2019, \u2018X2\u2019, \u2018Y2\u2019 where (\u2018X1\u2019, \u2018Y1\u2019) is an upper left corner.
