So the frequency array becomes [2, 2, 1]. Beauty of this array is 2 as it has the highest frequency.\n\nIn the second test case, the frequency of 7 and 5 is 1 and 2, respectively. So the frequency array becomes [1, 2]. In this array both elements have the same frequency, so we select the smaller one, i.e. 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n7 6 8 5\n5\n3 7 7 2 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 \n2\n</code></pre>\n",
