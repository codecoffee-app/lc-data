In one move you have to pick any two numbers &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B&#39; and replace them by their sum &#39;A+B&#39;. Doing this gives you a penalty of &#39;A+B&#39;. Note that the count of elements reduces by 1 every time you take 2 numbers and replace them by their sum. The game ends when there is only one element left.
