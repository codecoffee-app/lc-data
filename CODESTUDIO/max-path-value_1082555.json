Each node has a lowercase letter assigned to it. For any path, the path\u2019s value is defined as the maximum frequency of a letter on the path. You are supposed to find the maximum value of a path. If the maximum value can be infinitely large then return -1.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If some path has the letters \u201cxyxxxyzz\u201d then the value of this path will be 4 as the maximum frequency of any letter(\u2018x\u2019) is 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. The test cases are as follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers separated by a single space \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 denoting the number of the nodes and the number of edges respectively.\n\nThe next line contains a string of length \u2018N\u2019 consisting of lowercase letters, denoting the character assigned to each node. The &#39;i\u2019-th character of the string is assigned to the &#39;i\u2019-th node.\n\nThe next \u2018M\u2019 lines of each test case contain two integers, \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 separated by a single space, \u2018X\u2019 and \u2019Y\u2019 denote the vertices connected by an edge directed from \u2018X\u2019 to \u2018Y\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the maximum value of any path.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything, It has already been taken care of.

Try to find all the path starting from every node of the graph.    \n2. Think about some dynamic programming state that takes care of both node and some letter frequency.\n</code></pre>\n",
