You need to find the number of k-element subsequences of the given array where the bitwise AND of the subsequence&#39;s elements is maximal. Also, find the maximal AND value.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let the array be [1, 3, 6, 7] and K=3. The possible k-element subsequences of the given array are: {1, 3, 6}, {1, 3, 7}, {1, 6, 7}, {3, 6, 7}. Applying AND operation on all possible subsequences we get values: 0, 1, 0, 2 respectively. The maximal AND value of these subsequences is 2, and only 1 subsequence {3, 6, 7} has this value.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The very first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of every test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 denoting the number of elements present in the array and the length of the subsequences.\n\nThe second line of every test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the elements present in the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, two space-separated integers are printed denoting the maximal AND value and the number of subsequences having maximal AND value, respectively.\n\nOutput for each test case is printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The number of possible k-element subsequences having that maximal AND value can be very large. So, print the answer modulo 1000000007.\n\nYou do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just return an array of size two where the 1st element is max AND value and 2nd element is the number of subsequences having this maximal AND value. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 5 * 10^4\n2 &lt;= K &lt;= N\n0 &lt;= Arr[i] &lt;= 10^8\n\nWhere  \u2018T\u2019 represents the number of test cases, \u2018N\u2019 represents the number of elements present in the array and \u2018K\u2019 represents the length of the subsequences.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 3\n1 3 6 7\n3 2\n9 9 9    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2 1\n9 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-1\">Explanation 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case refer to the example explained above.\n\nFor the second test case we have, array: [9, 9, 9], N = 3 and K = 2. The possible k-element subsequences of the given array are: {9, 9}, {9, 9}, {9, 9}. Applying AND operation on all possible subsequences we get values: 9, 9, 9 respectively.
