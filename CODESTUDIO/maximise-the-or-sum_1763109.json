                        "explanation": "Selecting the sub-arrays {5, 8} from arr1 and {7, 16} from arr2 gives the maximum OR sum: (5 | 7) + (8 | 16) = 7 + 24 = 31. However the optimal solution is selecting sub-arrays {5, 8} and {7, 16}. So we need to calculate (5|7) + (8|16) = 7 + 24 = 31.  It looks like the explanation in the original problem is also off, the correct answer is 31. It turns out that choosing the subarrays [8,4] and [16,1] produces 24+5 = 29.  So, given those mistakes, the intended example is wrong. Let's consider all length 1 arrays [1] [3] = 2, [5] [7] = 7+5= 12, [8] [16] = 24, [4] [1] = 5. The max here is 24. Let's consider [1,5] [3,7]. 3+5=8, 1+7=8 => 8|8 = 8.  (1|3)+(5|7) = 3+7 = 10. [5,8][7,16]=>(5|7)+(8|16)=7+24=31. [8,4][16,1] => 24+5 = 29. [1,5,8][3,7,16]=>3+7+24=34. [5,8,4][7,16,1]=7+24+5=36.  [1,5,8,4] [3,7,16,1]=3+7+24+5=39. So we made it even more confusing. Let's look at length two sub-arrays: Starting positions are (0,0),(1,1),(2,2).  Or sums will be: [5,8][7,16] => (5|7)+(8|16)=7+24=31; [8,4][16,1] = (8|16)+(4|1) = 24+5=29. So max is 31.  If we take all the arrays of length one, then [1][3],[5][7],[8][16],[4][1]. Then 1|3+5|7+8|16+4|1 = 3+7+24+5=39. The instructions said to select two sub-arrays of equal length. This means that arr1 is [5,8] and arr2 is [7,16]. So sum is (5|7)+(8|16) = 7+24 = 31 is right now.  The question asks sum of ORS of two sub-arrays.  The example output of 36 means (5|8) + (7|16) = 13 + 23=36."

Let's evaluate {4,2,2} from arr1 and {12,3,1} from arr2, then or sum is 12+3+3=18. Let's evaluate {1,3,4} from arr1 and {1,3,12} from arr2 then or sum is 1+3+12=16.

If we take {2,3,4,5}{7,8,9,10} then we get: 7+11+13+15=46. If we take {5}{10}=15. IF we take {4}{9}=13. The question output is 29, then it must come from {1,2}{6,7} =7+7=14, {2,3}{7,8}=7+11=18. The correct explanation is we select sub-arrays {3,4} and {8,9} so or sum is (3|8)+(4|9) = 11+13=24. If we take {4,5} and {9,10}, or sum is (4|9)+(5|10) = 13+15=28."

The expected result is 29. Perhaps the calculation is incorrect. Calculating (7|8) = 15.  If we chose {7,9}{8,10} = (7|8)+(9|10)= 15+11=26. This is not equal to 29.  {5|6} + {7,8} = 7+15=22. If we choose {7,9}{8,10}= (7|8)+(9|10) = 15+11=26. if we take just {9}{10} = 11- which is not 29. The question seems to require the greatest sum of bitwise or of corresponding elements. Is there something about adjacent elements we are missing.  Let us calculate or sum for single elements: 3,7,7,15,11.. So max is 15 if take length 1 which is {7|8}. Let us calculate all or sum elements of len 2: (3|4)+(5|6)+(7|8)+(9|10) = 7+7+15+11=40. If we select subarrays {1,3,5,7}{2,4,6,8} we get (1|2)+(3|4)+(5|6)+(7|8) = 3+7+7+15 = 32. Choosing last 2 of sub arrays, {7,9}{8,10} -> (7|8)+(9|10)= 15+11=26. If you have [1 3 5][2 4 6]=3+7+7 = 17; So how do we find 29."
