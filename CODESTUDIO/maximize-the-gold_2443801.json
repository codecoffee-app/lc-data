The treasure has \u2018N\u2019 bags and each bag has some gold coins in it. Ninja thought of an interesting game, both players will play alternatively. In each turn, the player will choose to pick either the first sack or the last sack and the picked sack of gold will be removed from the treasure. The ninja will start the game and wants to collect the maximum coins possible. Both players will play optimally.
