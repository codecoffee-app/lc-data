Spiderman has to protect the planet earth, and for this, he has to give punches in the head of the zombie. The Spiderman is given an integer \u2018N\u2019 and he has to construct a number \u2018Num\u2019 such that the count of nice divisors of \u2018NUM\u2019 is maximum and the constructed number has at most &#39;N&#39; prime factors. It is not necessary for all prime factors of \u2018NUM\u2019 to be distinct. A divisor of \u2018NUM\u2019 is called nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of \u2018NUM\u2019.

Since 'nice' divisors are the divisors that are divisible by every prime factor of num, let the prime factorization of num be p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.  The number of 'nice' divisors is (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1) divided by the number of ways to pick one of each prime factor, which is just 1 if you have all distinct prime factors and a larger number if some prime factors are repeats. You need to have at least one of each. So, number of nice divisors = product of (exponent + 1). If NUM = 3^4 then number of divisors equals (4+1) = 5 divisors. If NUM = 2*3*5*7*11*13 we have 2^6 nice divisors. NUM = 3^4. Then the number of nice divisors are (4+1) but it needs to be divisible by every prime factor. Then 3^4 is NUM. number of nice divisors = 3^4. 36 = 2^2*3^2, nice divisors are divisible by 6. Divisors of 36 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. the nice divisors are 6,12,18,36. Total 4 nice divisors.  When n=12. The largest nice divisors is 324 by multiplying 3^12. (1+1) * 12 =13"
