Each node of the tree has an integer value. Your task is to find the maximum average of node values of any subtree of the given tree.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains elements in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is &#39;null&#39;, we take -1 on its place.\n\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/binarytree3-5126.png\" alt=\"Example Input\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1.\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the maximum average of node values of any subtree of the given tree. Your output will be considered correct if it differs from the actual output by no more than 10^(-5).\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 3000\n-10^5 &lt;= data &lt;= 10^5 and data!=-1\n\nTime Limit: 1 second\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1 2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n2 4 -1 6 -1 3 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4.00000\n4.50000\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation For Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case: \nThe subtree rooted at the node with value 4 has the maximum possible average, i.e., 4. Hence, the answer is 4 in this case.\n\nFor the second test case: \nThe subtree rooted at the node with value 6 has 2 nodes and the sum of the node values is 9. Therefore, the average is 4.5 which is the maximum possible average.
