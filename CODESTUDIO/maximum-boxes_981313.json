Now, you need to calculate the maximum number of boxes in which you can distribute these apples such that no apple is left and none of the boxes is partially filled.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Suppose, you have 7 apples and multiple boxes of capacities 2, 3 and 5.\n\nYou can keep these 7 apples in maximum 3 boxes i.e. two boxes of capacity 2 and one box of capacity 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer &#39;N&#39; denoting the number of apples.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains three space-separated integers &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, and &#39;C&#39; denoting the capacity of three types of boxes.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the maximum number of boxes in which you can distribute these &#39;N&#39; apples.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. If it is impossible to distribute the apples into the boxes, simply return 0. \n\n2. You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
