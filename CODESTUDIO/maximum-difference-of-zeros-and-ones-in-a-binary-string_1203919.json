To find out the maximum difference between the number of zeros and the number of ones in the substring of the string, We have a substring from index 2 to 2(length = 1), which consists of one \u20180\u2019s and zero \u20181\u2019s, So, the answer is 1 - 0 = 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2   \n000000\n0101010101\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>6\n1\n</code></pre>\n",
