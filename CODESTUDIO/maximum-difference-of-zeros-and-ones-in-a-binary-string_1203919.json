You are supposed to find the maximum difference between the number of zeros(0&#39;s) and the number of ones(1&#39;s) in any substring of the given string.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Binary String is a string that consists of only \u20180\u2019s and \u20181\u2019s.\n\nA string \u2018A\u2019 is said to be a substring of string \u2018B\u2019 if \u2018A\u2019 can be obtained by deleting several characters(possibly none) from the start of \u2018B\u2019 and by deleting several characters(possibly none) from the end of \u2018B\u2019.\n\nThe substring must have a length greater than or equal to 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.

To find out the maximum difference between the number of zeros and the number of ones in the substring of the string, We have a substring from index 2 to 8, which consists of all \u20180\u2019s except the 5th index, which is \u20181\u2019. So, the answer is 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nIn the second test case, the binary string is \u20181101\u2019. To find out the maximum difference between the number of zeros and the number of ones in the substring of the string, We have a substring from index 2 to 2(length = 1), which consists of one \u20180\u2019s and zero \u20181\u2019s, So, the answer is 1 - 0 = 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2   \n000000\n0101010101\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>6\n1\n</code></pre>\n",
