Stacks are represented as an array, and the first index of the array represents the top element of the stack.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Assume that you are given three stacks {2,5}, {5,1,6} and {7,2,3,4}. Initially sum of stack one is 7, stack 2 is 12, and stack 3 is 16. But if we remove 5 from stack 2 that is top of stack its sum becomes 7. Similarly, if we remove 7 and then 2 from stack 3 then its sum also becomes 7 so the maximum possible sum for this case is 7.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. If no such sum is possible return zero.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 6 * T lines represent the \u2018T\u2019 test cases as follows-\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n1 which denotes the size of the first \n\nThe second line of each test case contains space-separated integers that represent elements of the first stack and the starting element is the top of the stack. \n\nSimilarly, the next 4 lines represent the other two stacks in the same manner.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting is the maximum possible equal sum for the three stacks.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000\n1 &lt;= DATA &lt;= 10 ^ 6\n\nWhere \u2018T\u2019 is the total number of test cases, where N denotes the number of elements in any of the stacks and \u2018DATA\u2019 represents the data in the stacks.\n\nTime limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n4 5 2 3\n3\n3 1 4\n3\n2 2 1\n3\n4 9 6\n5\n1 4 5 5 5\n1\n15\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>5\n15\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-of-the-sample-input-1\">Explanation of The Sample Input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case:\n\nThe given stacks are {4,5,2,3}, {3,1,4}, {2,2,1} initially sum of individual stacks are 14, 8 and 5 but if we remove 4 and 5 from first stack and 3 from second stack then all the sum becomes equal, that is 5 therefore the answer will be 5.\n\nFor the second test case:\n\nThe given stacks are {4,9,6}, {1,4,5,5,5}, {15}. Initially, the sum of individual stacks are 19, 19 and 15 but if we remove 4 from the first stack and 1 and 4 from the second stack then the sum of individual stacks becomes equal, that is 15.
