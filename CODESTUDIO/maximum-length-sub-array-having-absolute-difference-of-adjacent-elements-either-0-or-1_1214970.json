So the required answer will be 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 - number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers that make up \u2018A\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum length of sub-array having an absolute difference of adjacent elements either 0 or 1.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
