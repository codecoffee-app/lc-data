You need to find the value of the maximum node that lies in between the nodes \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 (both inclusive) in the given BST.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-binary-search-tree-bst-is-a-binary-tree-data-structure-which-has-the-following-properties\">A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure which has the following properties.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>\u2022 The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node\u2019s data.\n\u2022 The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node\u2019s data.\n\u2022 Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. All the elements of the Binary Search Tree are unique.\n\n2. You can\u2019t use the same node value/element of BST twice.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, which denotes the number of test cases. Then each test case follows. \n\nThe first line of every test case contains elements of the Binary Search Tree in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains two integers denoting the value of nodes \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/tree-pic-11255.png\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>The input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n\n20 10 35 5 15 30 42 -1 13 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\n\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \n\nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer denoting the value of maximum node lies between \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print the output, it has already been taken care of.
