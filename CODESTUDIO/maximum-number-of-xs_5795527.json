The string \u2018S\u2019 consists of only two characters \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019. In one operation, you can select two indices \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018j\u2019, and flip each character of the substring from \u2018i\u2019 to \u2018j\u2019. Flip the characters means changing the character \u2018X\u2019 to \u2018Y\u2019 and the character \u2018Y\u2019 to \u2018X\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-need-to-perform-exactly-one-operation-find-the-maximum-number-of-x-s-in-the-string-s-that-you-can-get-after-performing-the-operation\">You need to perform exactly one operation.

Flip all the characters of the substring from 1 to 2, and we get \u2018S\u2019 = \u2018XXXX\u2019. Hence, the number of \u2018X\u2019s is 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line will contain the integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the length of the string \u2018S\u2019. \n\nThe second line of each test case contains an arbitrary string \u2018S\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, you don\u2019t need to print anything just return the maximum number \u2018X\u2019s you can get after performing exactly one operation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything.

Flip all the characters of the substring from 0 to 3, and we get \u2018S\u2019 = \u2018XXYXX\u2019.
