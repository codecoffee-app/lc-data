He has a rod of length \u2018N\u2019 units. He wants to earn maximum money by selling this rod in the market. So he cuts the rod into different sizes and each size has a cost associated with it. Determine the maximum money he can earn by cutting the rod and selling its pieces.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The sizes will range from 1 to \u2018N\u2019 and will be integers.\n\n2. The sum of the pieces cut should be equal to \u2018N\u2019.\n\n3. Consider 1-based indexing.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2 * T lines represent the \u2018T\u2019 test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the length of the rod.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a vector \u2019A\u2019, of size \u2018N\u2019 representing the cost of different lengths, where each index of the array is the sub-length and the element at that index is the cost for that sub-length.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Since 1-based indexing is considered, the 0th index of the vector will represent sub-length 1 of the rod. Hence the (N - 1)th index would represent the cost for the length \u2018N\u2019. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line that contains a single integer which is the maximum cost obtained by selling the pieces.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

                        "explanation": "The rod of length 5 can be cut into one piece of length 1 and two pieces of length 2, resulting in a total cost of 1 + 2 * 7 = 15, however better way is one of length 2 and one of length 3 i.e. 7+3=10, then one of length 1 and one of length 4, which is 1+9=10, but since we are allowded multiple cuts, we can cut the rod into two pieces of lengths 2 and one of length 1 which is 7+7+1=15.  A better approach is to cut the rod into one piece of length 5 for a cost of 9.  However, if the rod is cut into 5 individual pieces of length 1, the total cost would be 5 * 1 = 5. An even better solution is: two lengths of 2 and one length of 1: resulting in 7 + 7 + 1 = 15. An even better option: two lengths of 2 and one length of 1. However, cutting the rod into a piece of length 2 and a piece of length 3 results in a revenue of 7+3 = 10. Also one of length 1 and one of length 4 leads to 1+9 = 10. An even better is Two parts of length 1 and one of length 3 resulting in 1+1+3 = 5, then 1 part of length 2 and one part of length 3 resuling in 7+3 = 10 . optimal solution is two parts of length 1 and one part of length 3 + one part of length 1 = 2+1+9= 12. After re-evaluation the optimal solution is achieved by cutting it into two pieces of length 2 and one piece of length 1 for cost 7+7+1 = 15. \nOne cut of length 4 and one cut of length 1 is 9+1=10\nlength 2 and 3 is 7+3=10\nlength 1 and 4 is 1+9=10. If you cut the rod into two length 1 and one length 3 the total is 1+1+3 =5. Cut it two pieces of length 2 and one pieces of length 1 is 7+7+1=15. After trying diffrent approaches, cutting the rod to obtain maximum profit yields to a total of 22 by cutting the parts by length 4 twice then length 5 once, making it 9+9 = 18  or to the length of five once 9 and the other of length 1 making it 1+7+7=15, thus, we can find 2 +2 +1 making it 7+7+1 = 15."
