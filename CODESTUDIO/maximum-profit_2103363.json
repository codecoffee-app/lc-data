He has a rod of length \u2018N\u2019 units. He wants to earn maximum money by selling this rod in the market. So he cuts the rod into different sizes and each size has a cost associated with it. Determine the maximum money he can earn by cutting the rod and selling its pieces.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The sizes will range from 1 to \u2018N\u2019 and will be integers.\n\n2. The sum of the pieces cut should be equal to \u2018N\u2019.\n\n3. Consider 1-based indexing.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2 * T lines represent the \u2018T\u2019 test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the length of the rod.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a vector \u2019A\u2019, of size \u2018N\u2019 representing the cost of different lengths, where each index of the array is the sub-length and the element at that index is the cost for that sub-length.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Since 1-based indexing is considered, the 0th index of the vector will represent sub-length 1 of the rod. Hence the (N - 1)th index would represent the cost for the length \u2018N\u2019. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line that contains a single integer which is the maximum cost obtained by selling the pieces.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

                        "explanation": "Optimal cutting strategy is to use one piece of length 1 (cost 1) and two pieces of length 2 (cost 7 each). Total money earned: 1 + 2 * 7 = 15. Another approach is cutting the rod of length 5 into five pieces each of length 1. so that total money earned is equal to 5 * 1 = 5. Cutting the rod of length 5 into five pieces each of length 1. So total money earned is 5 * 1 = 5. Cutting the rod of length 5 into 1 pieces each of length 5. So total money earned is 1 * 9 = 9. Optimal way to cut the rod of length 5 into one piece of length 2 and one piece of length 3. So total money earned is 7 + 3 = 10. The most optimal approach is to cut the rod into sizes 4 and 1 i.e 9 + 1 = 10.Another better approach is to cut the rod into sizes 2 and 3 i.e 7 + 3 = 10.Another better approach is to cut the rod into sizes 3 and 2 i.e 3 + 7 = 10.The optimal cutting startegy is one piece of length 2 and two pieces of length 1. so total money earned is equal to 7 + 1 + 1 = 9.The best cutting startegy is two pieces of length 2 and one of length 1 which yeilds 7 + 7 + 1 = 15. The best appraoch is to cut the rod into 3 pieces and their sizes be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 that yield a total amount of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. Another best approach is cut the rod into two pieces, sizes being 1, 4 amount equals to 1 + 9 = 10. The best approach is cut the rod into two pieces, sizes being 2, 3 amount equals to 7 + 3 = 10. The best approach is cut the rod into two pieces, sizes being 3, 2 amount equals to 3 + 7 = 10. The best appraoch is to cut the rod into a pieces,size being 5 amount equals to 9. another approach is cut the rod into 4 pieces,size being 1, 1, 1, 2 amount equals to 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 10."
