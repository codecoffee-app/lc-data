This will make our score 3. The piles will now contain 0, 1, and 2 stones respectively. We can now choose pile 2 and pile 3 one time. This will make our score 4. The piles will now contain 0, 0, and 1 stone respectively. Since there are no two different non-empty piles of stones game comes to an end. Therefore the answer is 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.
