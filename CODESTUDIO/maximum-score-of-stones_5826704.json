You are given \u2018N\u2019 stones. Each stone has a value associated with it. The value of each stone is given by a 0-indexed array \u2018NUMS\u2019 where \u2018NUMS[ i ]\u2019 denotes the value of the \u2018i\u2019th stone.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-game-starts-with-you-and-your-friend-are-standing-on-the-k-th-stone-the-game-consists-of-two-parts\">The game starts with you and your friend are standing on the \u2018K\u2019th stone.

From any \u2018i\u2019th stone you can jump to (\u2018i\u2019 + 1)th stone or (\u2018i\u2019 + 2)th stone and then collect the value of that stone. You can stop at any stone anytime. You can make 0 or more than 0 moves of this kind.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"second-part-consists-of-your-friend-jumping-backward-the-stone-at-which-you-stopped-your-friend-will-start-jumping-backward-from-that-stone-and-collect-the-value-of-the-stones-from-any-i-th-stone-your-friend-can-jump-to-i-1-th-stone-or-i-2-th-stone-and-then-collect-the-value-of-that-stone-your-friend-can-make-0-or-more-than-0-moves-of-this-kind\">Second part consists of your friend jumping backward. The stone at which you stopped, your friend will start jumping backward from that stone and collect the value of the stones. From any \u2018i\u2019th stone your friend can jump to (\u2018i\u2019 - 1)th stone or (\u2018i\u2019 - 2)th stone and then collect the value of that stone.
