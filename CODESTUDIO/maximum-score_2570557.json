The game has certain rules and the player has to pick some numbers from the given list and the score is the sum of unique picked numbers. The rules are:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1.  Choose any list \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019.\n2.  Traverse from left to right.\n3.  After picking a number, if the picked number is present in both the arrays, you are allowed to traverse to the other array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-arrays-a-and-b-of-size-n-and-m-respectively-your-task-is-to-find-the-maximum-score-ninja-can-achieve\">You are given arrays,\u2019A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 of size \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 respectively.
