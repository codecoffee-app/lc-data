So, you have decided to buy shares of a certain company. Now, you have an initial capital of Rs \u2018K\u2019. You know the prices of the particular stock for the next \u2018N\u2019 days. On an ith day, you can buy up to i shares. To maximize the profit you want to buy a maximum number of shares, so find the maximum number of shares you can buy if you buy optimally.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let, \nK = 45\nN =3\nPRICES = [10, 7, 19]\nAnswer:- 4\nThe answer should be 4 because you can purchase 1 stock on day 1,2 stocks on day 2 and 1 stock on day 3. Hence, total amount spent is 10*1 + 7*2 + 19*1 = 43 and number of stocks purchased is 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018K\u2019 denoting the initial capital you have.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of days for which you know the price for the particular stock.\n\nThe third line contains \u2018N\u2019 integers of the array \u2018PRICES\u2019 denoting the price of the stock on an ith day.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the maximum amount of stocks you can buy if you act in an optimal manner.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n 1 &lt;= K &lt;= 10^9\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= PRICES[i] &lt;= 10^9\n\nTime Limit = 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n6\n3\n1 2 3\n1\n2\n3 10\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the answer should be 3 because you can buy 1 share on the first day and 2 shares on the second day.\nIn the second test case, the answer should be 0 because you can\u2019t buy any number of shares on any day.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n100\n3\n7 10 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>6\n</code></pre>\n",
