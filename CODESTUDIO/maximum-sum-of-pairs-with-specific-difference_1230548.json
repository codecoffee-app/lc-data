However sorting it will give a better answer in this case, [1,2], [3,4] gives 10. And by looking at it closely we find that [2,3] [4,5] can be paired too so lets sort it which is [1,2,3,4,5], we will get: (1,2) diff is 1 < 2 so we have 3. (3,4) gives diff 1 < 2 so we have 7. so the answer is 10 in this case. However another valid choice of disjoint pairs can be (1,2) and (3,4). Thus sum is 1+2+3+4 = 10. The code however returns 14 which is wrong so we can instead have (1,2) and (3,4) and (5, nothing) gives 1+2+3+4 = 10. It is important to sort the array"
