For example, if the given array \u201cNUMS\u201d = {1, 2, 5, 4, 8}, then {1, 2, 5, 4, 8}, {1, 5, 8}, {2} are some of the valid subsequences whereas the sequence {4, 2} is not a valid subsequence as the order of the elements differ from the original array.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K, denoting the number of elements in the array and the length of the subsequence to be considered.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print in a new line, an integer denoting the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence of length K.\n\nPrint \u201c-1\u201d if no such subsequence exists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
