The optimal pair would be points[i] and points[i+1] where i=0,1,2,...,8. The result is y[i]+y[j] + |x[i]-x[j]| = y[i]+y[i+1] + 0.  If we pick 1,1 and 2,2 as points, that is 1+2+0=3. However the question says 'It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points in the given array/list that satisfies the constraint'. Because k=0, only points with same x values can form a valid pair and achieve the maximum. Since there is no two points with the same x value, then we must find two consecutive points."
