You need to return P and Q.\n\nFor Mode, if the highest frequency of more than one element is the same, return the smallest element.\n\nFor Example, for the given array {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}, the mode will be 1 as it is the smallest of all the possible modes i.e 1, 2 and 3.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of queries or test cases. \n\nThe first line of every test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the input array.\n\nThe second line of every test case contains N single space-separated integers representing the elements of the input array. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, \nThe first line of output will contain 2 single space-separated integers representing P, and Q for the Mean of the array.\n\nThe second line of output will contain 2 single space-separated integers representing P, and Q for the Median of the array.\n\nThe third line of the output will contain an integer representing the Mode of the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Thus, (3 + 3 + 1 + 4)/4 = 11 / 4. Where P = 11 and Q = 4 and P, Q are coprime. \n\nTo find the median, we will sort the array in ascending order and find the average of n/2 and (n/2 + 1)th number if N is even and (n+1)/2th number if N is odd. Thus, (3+3)/2 = 6 / 2. Thus P = 3 and Q = 1 and P, Q are coprimes.\n\nTo find the mode, we will find the element with the highest frequency which is 3 with a frequency of two and thus, the Mode is 3.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n5\n7 6 5 5 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>26 5 \n5 1 \n5 \n</code></pre>\n",
