Thus, (3 + 3 + 1 + 4)/4 = 11 / 4. Where P = 11 and Q = 4 and P, Q are coprime. \n\nTo find the median, we will sort the array in ascending order and find the average of n/2 and (n/2 + 1)th number if N is even and (n+1)/2th number if N is odd. Thus, (3+3)/2 = 6 / 2. Thus P = 3 and Q = 1 and P, Q are coprimes.\n\nTo find the mode, we will find the element with the highest frequency which is 3 with a frequency of two and thus, the Mode is 3.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n5\n7 6 5 5 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>26 5 \n5 1 \n5 \n</code></pre>\n",
