Goddess Elizabeth is being trapped by the demons. She is kept at the center of the maze. Prince Meliodas is worried and he wants to save Elizabeth at any cost. He killed all the demons guarding the maze. Only the four corners of the maze are open for Meliodas to enter. The magical spell of the demons guarded the maze is still in effect. Thus, there is a limitation on the movement of Meliodas. At any cell of the maze, he can move exactly X steps in only four directions, i.e. Up, Down, Left, and Right where X is the power of each cell of the maze.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-an-n-n-maze-of-non-negative-integers-where-each-integer-denotes-the-power-of-that-cell-you-have-to-find-the-number-of-ways-in-which-meliodas-can-save-goddess-elizabeth\">Given an N * N maze of non negative integers, where each integer denotes the power of that cell.
