Create two classes, `Square` and `Rectangle`, that inherit from `Shape`.  `Square` and `Rectangle` should have `length` and `breadth` fields respectively. Implement a `calculateArea` function in both `Square` and `Rectangle` to return the area, and a `printMyType` function to print the object's type. In the `main` function, create a `Square` object with `length = 5` and call `printMyType` and `calculateArea`. Then create a `Rectangle` object with `length = 5` and `breadth = 4` and call `printMyType` and `calculateArea`.",
