One day he was playing with his mom\u2019s mobile. The mobile keypad contains 12 buttons { 10 digits(0-9) and 2 characters(\u2018*\u2019 and \u2018#\u2019) }. Mike wants to know how many different numbers he can generate after pressing exactly the &#39;N&#39; buttons on the keypad. Mike presses the buttons with the following rules:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. He always presses the button which has a digit written on it, i.e., he never presses the \u2018*\u2019 and \u2018#\u2019 button.\n2. Once he presses a button, the next button he presses should either be the same button or the button which is adjacent to the previous button.\n3. In starting he can press any button except \u2018*\u2019 and \u2018#\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/mobile-7023.jpg\" alt=\"mobile\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"mike-is-too-little-to-solve-this-problem-help-mike-to-solve-this-problem-as-the-answer-can-be-large-so-find-the-answer-modulo-10-9-7\">Mike is too little to solve this problem.
