But being a busy person, you don\u2019t have enough time to give milk to each child by yourself. To distribute the milk efficiently, you arrange children in the following structure and ask them to pass the milk.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000545_1637907016_Milk-flow-problem.png\" alt=\"\">    </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"suppose-you-give-x-liters-of-milk-to-child-1-then-he-will-take-1-liter-for-himself-and-pass-the-remaining-milk-to-child-2-and-child-3-in-equally-half-each-child-repeats-the-same-process-based-on-the-amount-of-milk-they-get-if-a-child-has-less-than-1-liter-of-milk-he-doesnt-pass-anything-to-the-next-child\">Suppose you give &#39;X&#39; liters of milk to child-1, then he will take 1 liter for himself and pass the remaining milk to child-2 and child-3 in equally half. Each child repeats the same process based on the amount of milk they get. If a child has less than 1 liter of milk, he doesn&#39;t pass anything to the next child.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"e-g-if-child-2-has-6-liters-of-milk-he-keeps-1-liter-for-himself-and-passes-2-5-liters-to-child-4-and-2-5-liters-to-child-5-it-can-be-seen-that-child-5-gets-milk-from-child-2-and-child-3-both-but-he-can-take-a-total-of-1-liter-for-himself-and-have-to-pass-the-remaining\">E.g., If child-2 has 6 liters of milk, he keeps 1 liter for himself and passes 2.5 liters to child-4 and 2.5 liters to child-5. It can be seen that child-5 gets milk from child-2 and child-3 both. But he can take a total of 1 liter for himself and have to pass the remaining.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"if-x-liters-of-milk-is-given-to-child-1-find-the-amount-of-milk-a-child-has-standing-in-the-n-th-row-from-top-to-bottom-at-m-th-position-from-left-to-right\">If &#39;X&#39; liters of milk is given to child-1, find the amount of milk a child has, standing in the &#39;N&#39;-th row (from top to bottom) at &#39;M&#39;-th position (from left to right).</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of tests.\nFor each Test :\n    The only line contains three space-separated integers &#39;X&#39;, &#39;N&#39; and &#39;M&#39;, denoting amount of milk, row number and position of child from left, respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test, print one floating number (with 6 digits of precision), denoting the amount of milk a child has, standing in &#39;N&#39;-th row at &#39;M&#39;-th position.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output.

A total of 2 liters of milk is given to child-1. He keeps one liter for himself and passes 0.5 liters to child-2 and child-3 each.

He keeps 1 liter and passes the remaining to the next.

If a child receives less than 1 liter of milk, they keep it all and don't pass any further. Your task is to determine the final amount of milk a specific child has received, given their position in the structure (row 'N' and position 'M').",
