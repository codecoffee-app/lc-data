The minimum difference comes when the modifications are -2 for 2 ie [3,0,1]. The max-min is 3-0=3 and increasing 2 results in [3,4,1] hence max-min is 3. Other modifications may result in higher differences so the minimum differece is 2, achieved through [3,4,1] when max and min difference is 3. \nAnother optimal array is [3,0,1] where max-min is 3 again.\nFinally consider decreasing element by K which is [3, 0, 1] hence max and min element difference is 3.\nFinal Result being 2 comes from 3,4,1 where 4-1=3 or 3,0,1 where 3-1=2.\nSince 1,2,3 array with + or - 2 goes to -1, 0 , 1,3,4,5 and the minimum difference we can generate by considering one element increase and one element decrease is [3,2,1] where 3-1 = 2 "
