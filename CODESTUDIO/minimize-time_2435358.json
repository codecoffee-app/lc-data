A better optimal solution is taking the tasks at index 0 and 2. Then 1+3 is not the optimal solution so let's evaluate all other choices to arrive to an optimal solution. Another example would be to take task at index 1, 3, then 2+4=6 which is an invalid solution so the optimal solution here is to skip either two non consecutives tasks."
