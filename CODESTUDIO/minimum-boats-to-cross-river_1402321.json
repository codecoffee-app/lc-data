They have come across a river and want to cross the river with the help of boats. There are a total of &#39;N&#39; people on the trip including Ninja himself. The weight of each person is given in an array &#39;ARR&#39;. One boat can accommodate at most two persons only if the sum of their weight does not exceed &#39;L&#39;, i.e., the maximum weight capacity of the boat, otherwise, the boat will accommodate only one person. Given the weight of each person and the maximum weight capacity &#39;L&#39;, your task is to find the minimum number of boats required to ensure that everyone crosses the river.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, &#39;N&#39; and &#39;L&#39;, denoting the number of elements in the array &#39;ARR&#39;, and the maximum weight capacity of one boat respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array &#39;ARR&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer - the minimum number of boats required.    \n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
