Therefore, the answer is 1 in this case.\n\nFor the second test case:\nLet&#39;s try all the array elements one by one\n1) To convert &quot;*bc&quot; into &quot;bcs&quot; we need a &#39;*&#39; at the end of string S which is not present. Hence string S is not compatible with string  &quot;bcs&quot;. \n2) To convert &quot;*bc&quot; into &quot;bce&quot; we need a &#39;*&#39; at the end of string S which is not present. Hence string S is not compatible with string &quot;bce&quot;.\n3) To convert &quot;*bc&quot; into &quot;bcc&quot; we need a &#39;*&#39; at the end of string S which is not present. Hence string S is not compatible with string &quot;bcc&quot;. \nWe can see that string &#39;S&#39; is not compatible with any of the array elements.
