You need to find and return the minimum number of characters to be deleted from \u2018STR\u2019 so that the frequency of each character in the string becomes unique.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the given string is \u201caaBBccc\u201d then the frequency of characters: { a:2, B:2, c:3 }. Now, as \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 both have the same frequency 2, we need to delete one character either one \u2018a\u2019 or one \u2018B\u2019, to make their frequency different. After deleting any character we will get frequency as 1,2 and 3, as they all are different. Thus we got our solution as 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string &#39;STR&#39;. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the minimum number of characters to be deleted from the string &#39;STR&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the output, it has already been taken care of.
