These computers are connected by &#39;M&#39; wires. Each wire connects two different computers. Information can be transmitted between two computers if there exists a path between the two computers by travelling through some ( possibly Zero ) intermediate computers. The cafe owner wants to remove some of the existing wires and then use those wires to connect some other pair of computers in such a manner that after the rearrangement, it is possible to transmit information between all the pairs of computers.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-the-description-of-each-of-the-m-wires-i-e-the-two-computers-that-the-wire-connects-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-number-of-wires-that-the-cafe-owner-needs-to-remove-and-rearrange-to-satisfy-the-above-conditions\">You are given the description of each of the &#39;M&#39; wires, i.e., the two computers that the wire connects.
