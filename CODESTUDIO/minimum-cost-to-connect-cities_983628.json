These &#39;N&#39; states are connected by &#39;M&#39; bidirectional roads. Each road connects to different states and has some cost to travel from one state to another. Now, the chief wants you to select &#39;N&#39; - 1 roads in such a way that the tourist bus can travel to every state at least once at minimum &#39;COST&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider a country having 4 states numbered from 1 to 4. These 4 states are connected by 5 bidirectional roads given as :\n1 --- 2 with cost = 8\n2 --- 3 with cost = 6\n3 --- 4 with cost = 5\n1 --- 4 with cost = 2\n1 --- 3 with cost = 4\n\nThe map of the country can be represented as:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/first1-6789.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>Now, the best way to choose 3 roads is:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/first2-6791.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>The cost of travelling from any state to all other states is  2 + 4 + 6 i.e. 12.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; denoting the number of test cases or queries to be run. \n\nThe first line of each test case or query contains two space-separated integers &#39;N&#39; and \u2018M\u2019 representing the number of states and number of roads in the country, respectively. \n\nThe next &#39;N&#39; lines of every test case contain three single space-separated integers \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019, representing a road between the states &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; denoting the cost of travelling them.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print &#39;N&#39; - 1 lines each containing 3 space separated integers &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; representing the road you have chosen and the cost to traverse that road.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Now the possible ways are.\n\n1. (1, 2) (2, 3) (1, 4): In this case, the total cost of travelling is 3 + 1 + 5 = 9.\n2. (1, 2) (2, 3) (3, 4): In this case, the total cost of travelling is 3 + 1 + 8 = 12.\n3. (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 4): in this case, the total cost of travelling is 3 + 5 + 8 = 16.\n4. (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 4): In this case, the total cost of travelling is 5 + 1 + 8 = 14.\n\nClearly, the cost is minimal in the first case so we pick (1, 2) ( 2, 3) (1, 4) with cost of travel 9.
