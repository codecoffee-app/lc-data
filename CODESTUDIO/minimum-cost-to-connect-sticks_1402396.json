You have to connect all sticks into one. At a time, you can join any two sticks by paying a cost of \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 where \u2018X\u2019 is the length of the first stick and \u2018Y\u2019 is the length of the second stick and the new stick we get will have a length equal to (X+Y). You have to find the minimum cost to connect all the sticks into one.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019, representing the total number of sticks. \n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers denoting the length of each stick.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the minimum cost to connect all the sticks into one by performing the above-mentioned operation.\n\nOutput for each test case is printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

Now we will connect sticks of length 5 and 4 to form one complete stick of length 9 which gives a cost of 9 and a total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.\n\nFor the second test case, \nWe have sticks of length {1, 8, 3, 5}. First, connect sticks of length 1 and 3 to form a stick of length 4 and which gives a cost of 4. Now we have sticks of length as {4, 8, 5}. Then connect sticks of length 4 and 5 to form a stick of length 9 and it gives a cost of 9. Now we have sticks of length as {9, 8}. Finally, connect the stick of length 8 and 9 which gives a cost of 17 and a total cost is 4 + 9 + 17= 30.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n2 9 7\n2\n10 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code> 27\n 19\n</code></pre>\n",
