Each cell of the grid has an integer value written on it which denotes the cost it takes to pass through that cell. You are currently present at the Top-Left cell (0,0) and you want to reach the Bottom-Right cell (N - 1, M - 1). To do so, you start moving from the Top-Left cell and move through any of the adjacent cells until you reach the Bottom-Right cell. The total cost of the path will be the sum of the costs of all the cells that you have passed through in the path.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-the-cost-of-each-cell-in-a-2-d-matrix-mat-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-total-cost-that-you-need-to-spend-to-reach-the-bottom-right-cell-if-you-are-starting-from-the-top-left-cell\">Given the cost of each cell in a 2 - D matrix &#39;MAT&#39;, your task is to find the minimum total cost that you need to spend to reach the Bottom-Right cell if you are starting from the Top-Left cell.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1) From any cell you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n2) You cannot move out of the grid.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, &#39;N&#39; and &#39;M&#39;, denoting the number of rows and columns in the grid respectively.\n\nEach of the next &#39;N&#39; lines contains &#39;M&#39; space-separated integers denoting the cell values of the grid.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the minimum total cost that you need to spend to reach the Bottom-Right cell if you are starting from the Top-Left cell.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output. it has already been taken care of.
