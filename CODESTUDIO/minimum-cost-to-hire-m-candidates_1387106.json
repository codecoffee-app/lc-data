The candidates have been evaluated on the basis of their skills and have been asked for their minimum salary expectations. So, you are given two arrays, \u2018SKILL\u2019 and \u2018EXPECTED&#95;SALARY\u2019, where \u2018SKILL[i]\u2019 and \u2018EXPECTED&#95;SALARY[i]\u2019 represent the skill and minimum salary expectation of \u2018i-th\u2019 candidate, respectively. You have to consider the following two rules for hiring a group of \u2018M\u2019 candidates:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1) Every candidate in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their skill compared to other candidates in the paid group.\n2) The minimum salary expectation of every candidate in the paid group should be fulfilled.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-return-the-minimum-amount-of-money-required-to-hire-m-candidates-as-per-the-above-mentioned-rules\">You have to return the minimum amount of money required to hire \u2018M\u2019 candidates as per the above-mentioned rules.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Answers which are within the range 10^-6 of the correct answer will be considered correct.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the number of total candidates.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers representing the elements of the \u2018SKILL\u2019 array.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers representing the elements of \u2018EXPECTED_SALARY\u2019 array.\n\nThe last line of each test case contains an integer \u2018M\u2019 representing the number of candidates to be hired.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the minimum cost to hire \u2018M\u2019 candidates.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
