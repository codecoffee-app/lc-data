A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell (0,0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (M - 1, N - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path doesn&#39;t have to be the shortest. You are allowed to change the sign of any cell only once as per your wish by incurring a cost of 1. So you are supposed to find the minimum cost to make at least one valid path in a grid.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.
