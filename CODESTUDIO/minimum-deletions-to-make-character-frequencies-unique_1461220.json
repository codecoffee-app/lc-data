Your take is to find out the minimum number of character deletions required such that each character in the final string has a unique frequency.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string \u2018STR\u2019 denoting the initial string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the minimum number of character deletions required such that each character in the final string has a unique frequency.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Therefore after deletion of one character of either \u2018b\u2019 or \u2018c\u2019 makes the frequencies 1,2 and 3.\n\nTest Case 2 :\nThe frequency of &#39;g&#39; is 1, &#39;t&#39; is 3 and &#39;q&#39; is 2. Therefore there is no need for a delete operation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nabbccc\ncbbd\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>0\n1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-2\">Explanation For Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, each character already has a unique frequency(1 for \u2018a\u2019, 2 for \u2018b\u2019 and 3 for \u2018c\u2019), hence we don\u2019t need to do any deletions.\n\nFor the second test case frequency of \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 is equal hence we need to delete either of them. Therefore the answer is 1.\n</code></pre>\n",
