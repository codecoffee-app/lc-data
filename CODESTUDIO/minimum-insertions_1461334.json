She discovered that it is possible to make an array of \u2018N\u2019 integers say \u2018arr1\u2019, a subsequence of another array of \u2018M\u2019 integers, say \u2018arr2\u2019, by inserting 0 or more integers into the array \u2018arr2\u2019. As she is busy with her studies, she asked you to find the minimum number of integers that need to be inserted into \u2018arr2\u2019 to make \u2018arr1\u2019 a subsequence of  \u2018arr2\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1) \u2018arr1\u2019 consists of distinct positive integers, and \u2018arr2\u2019 can contain duplicates.\n2) You are allowed to insert integers at any position in \u2018arr2\u2019.
