It has a very unique transportation method between shops. Since the shops in the mall are laying in a straight line, you can jump on a very advanced trampoline from the shop i, and land in any shop between (i) to (i\u2009+\u2009Arr[i]), where Arr[i] is a constant given for each shop.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"there-are-n-shops-in-the-mall-numbered-from-0-to-n-1-bobs-wife-starts-her-shopping-journey-from-shop-0-and-ends-it-in-shop-n-1-as-the-mall-is-very-crowded-on-fridays-unfortunately-bob-gets-lost-from-his-wife-so-he-wants-to-know-what-is-the-minimum-number-of-trampoline-jumps-from-shop-0-he-has-to-make-in-order-to-reach-shop-n-1-and-see-his-wife-again-if-it-is-impossible-to-reach-the-last-shop-return-1\">There are N shops in the mall, numbered from 0 to N-1. Bob&#39;s wife starts her shopping journey from shop 0 and ends it in shop N-1. As the mall is very crowded on Fridays, unfortunately, Bob gets lost from his wife. So he wants to know, what is the minimum number of trampoline jumps from shop 0 he has to make in order to reach shop N-1 and see his wife again. If it is impossible to reach the last shop, return -1.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. \n\nThen the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer N, which represents the number of shops.\n\nThe next line contains &#39;N&#39; single space-separated positive integers representing a constant given for each shop.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the minimum number of jumps or -1, if it is impossible to reach the last shop.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
