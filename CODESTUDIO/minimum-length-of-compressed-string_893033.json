Therefore, the optimal way is to delete &#39;d&#39; and &#39;f&#39;, then the compressed string will be &quot;c3e3&quot; of length 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. \n\nThen the &#39;T&#39; test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string &#39;STR&#39;.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single integer &#39;K&#39;, representing the maximum deletions allowed in the string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the length of the minimum compressed string after deleting at-most &#39;K&#39; characters in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
