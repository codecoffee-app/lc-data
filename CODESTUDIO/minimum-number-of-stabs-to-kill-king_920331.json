The first kind of stab decreases the king\u2019s health &#39;H&#39; by 1 i.e &#39;H&#39; = &#39;H&#39;-1.\n2. The second kind of stab decreases the king\u2019s health to &#39;H1&#39;, where &#39;H&#39;= &#39;H1&#39;*&#39;H2&#39; and &#39;H1&#39; &gt;= &#39;H2&#39; &gt; 1 i.e if &#39;H&#39; = &#39;H1&#39;*&#39;H2&#39;, then &#39;H&#39; can decrease to &#39;H1&#39; where &#39;H1&#39; is the larger factor.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1.

So, we can reduce kings health from 8 to 4 after one stab of type 2. \nNow since, 4 = 2*2, so after the second stab of type 2, king\u2019s health reduces from 4 to 2. \nThe current health of king = 2. After the third stab of type 1, the king\u2019s health reduces from 2 to 1.\nFinally, after the fourth stab of type 1, the king\u2019s health reduces from 1 to 0.\nSo, in total it takes 4 steps at minimum to kill the king.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n</code></pre>\n",
