So the output is 0.\n\nFor the second test case, \n\nInitially, the array \u2018ARR\u2019 is [1, 3, 5]. So in the first operation, we will increment element 1 by one and decrement element 5 by one and the updated array will look like [2, 3, 4]. \n\nThen we perform a second operation in which we will increment 2 by one and decrement element 4 by one and the updated array will look like [3, 3, 3].
