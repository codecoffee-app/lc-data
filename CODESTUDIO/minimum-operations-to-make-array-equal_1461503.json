Since the array has only a single element therefore it will require 0 operations to make all array elements equal. So the output is 0.\n\nFor the second test case, \n\nInitially, the array \u2018ARR\u2019 is [1, 3, 5]. So in the first operation, we will increment element 1 by one and decrement element 5 by one and the updated array will look like [2, 3, 4]. \n\nThen we perform a second operation in which we will increment 2 by one and decrement element 4 by one and the updated array will look like [3, 3, 3]. So finally all the elements of the array become equal in 2 operations. So the output is 2.   \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n6\n5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>9\n6\n</code></pre>\n",
