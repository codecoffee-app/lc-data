You need to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array equal. You can perform addition, multiplication, subtraction or division with any element on an array element.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"addition-subtraction-multiplication-or-division-on-any-element-of-the-array-will-be-considered-as-a-single-operation\">Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication or Division on any element of the array will be considered as a single operation.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If the given array is [1,2,3] then the answer would be 2. One of the ways to make all the elements of the given array equal is by adding 1 to the array element with value 1 and subtracting 1 from the array element with value 3. So that final array would become [2,2,2]. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer &#39;N&#39; representing the length of the array.\n\nThe second line contains &#39;N&#39; single space-separated integers representing elements of the array &#39;ARR&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return an integer in a single line i.e. the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of.

Hence the answer is 3.\n\nIn test case 2, There is only 1 element and hence no need to make equal and so answer is 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n2 4 2\n5\n1 2 1 4 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-input-2\">Explanation for Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In test case 1, by dividing 4 by 2 (i.e. 4 / 2) we can have all the elements equal to 2. Thus only 1 operation is performed and so answer is 1.\n\nIn test case 2, There can be many ways by which we can convert the array elements equal, one of the way is:\n\n2 / 2 = 1\n4 / 4 = 1\n\nHere the first operand is the elements of the array and the second operand is the operation that we did for making all the numbers of the array equal.\n\nHence, we did 2 operations to change the elements of the array to 2.
