To celebrate your new year eve, you reach your friend&#39;s house. Your friend knows you love video games, so he made you a game as a present. In the game, you have \u2018N\u2019 enemies located at distinct positive integers points on the number line. You have an array \u2018L\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019, where \u2018L[i]\u2019 represents the position of the \u2018ith\u2019 enemy.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-also-have-k-bombs-each-of-power-r-when-you-blast-a-bomb-of-power-r-at-position-i-it-will-destroy-everything-within-a-range-i-r-i-r-to-win-the-game-you-have-to-find-the-minimum-value-of-r-such-that-it-is-possible-to-destroy-every-enemy-it-is-not-necessary-to-use-all-k-bombs\">You also have \u2018K\u2019 bombs each of power \u2018R\u2019. When you blast a bomb of power \u2018R\u2019  at position \u2018i\u2019, it will destroy everything within a range [i - R, i + R]. To win the game, you have to find the minimum value of \u2018R\u2019, such that it is possible to destroy every enemy. It is not necessary to use all \u2018K\u2019 bombs.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let\u2019s say the array \u2018L\u2019 = [1, 3, 4, 5] and &#39;K&#39; = 2 then after bombing at position \u20182\u2019 with a bomb of power \u20181\u2019, enemies in the range [1, 3] will be destroyed. So the remaining enemy will be at position [4, 5]. These two can be bombed by placing another bomb at position &#39;4&#39;. Hence, the power is &#39;1&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>First-line contains \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of Test cases.\nFor each Test case:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, denoting the number of enemies and number of bombs you have.\nThe following line contains an array \u2018L\u2019 of \u2018N\u2019 space-separated distinct positive integers representing the enemy\u2019s location. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format-</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, you have to print a non-negative integer denoting the minimum power of the bomb, such that it is possible to destroy every enemy.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything.
