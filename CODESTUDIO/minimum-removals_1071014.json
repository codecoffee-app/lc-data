You have also given an integer &#39;K&#39;.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-number-of-elements-that-should-be-removed-from-arr-possibly-zero-such-that-the-difference-between-the-maximum-element-and-the-minimum-element-of-the-remaining-arr-is-less-than-or-equal-to-k-i-e-arrmax-arrmin-k\">Your task is to find the minimum number of elements that should be removed from &quot;ARR&quot; (possibly zero) such that the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element of the remaining &quot;ARR&quot; is less than or equal to &#39;K&#39;, i.e. ARRmax -  ARRmin  &lt;= K.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. &quot;ARR&quot; can contain duplicates.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Input: &#39;N&#39; = 4 , &quot;ARR&quot; =  [5, 10 , 2] and &#39;K&#39; = 3.\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation : Currently, the difference between the maximum and minimum element in the array is 10 - 2 = 8, which is greater than K (3). \nSo, we need to remove some elements. The optimal way to get our result is to remove 10. After removing 10, the difference between maximum and minimum is 5 - 2 = 3, which is less than or equal to K.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single-space separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 single space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array/list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Print the minimum number of elements that should be removed such that the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element of the remaining array is less than or equal to K.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n\nNote: You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

So, we need to remove some elements. The optimal way to get our result is to remove any 2 elements from the array because if we remove any one element, the difference between maximum and minimum will not become less than K (1). \n\nAfter removing any two elements the difference between maximum and minimum element becomes 0 which is less than or equal to K (1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 0\n2 6 -5 2\n4 4\n1 2 5 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n0    \n</code></pre>\n",
