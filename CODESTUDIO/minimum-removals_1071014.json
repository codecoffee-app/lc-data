The optimal way to get our result is to remove 10. After removing 10, the difference between maximum and minimum is 5 - 2 = 3, which is less than or equal to K.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.

Removing 2 results in [5, 10, 1] with a difference of 10 - 1 = 9 > 3. Removing 10 results in [5, 2, 1] with max-min = 4 > k=3. The solution is obtained by sorting the array [1,2,5,10], with k = 3. Iterate through each number as the minimum number and find the maximum number that satisfy the constraint Arr[max] - Arr[min] <= K. \n\nArr[0] = 1: Arr[max] = Arr[min] + 3 = 4, so the elements satisfy the constraint are [1,2,3,4], so Arr[max] = 2 in [1,2,5,10] can fulfill the constraint Arr[2] - Arr[0] = 1. Then the answer is n - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. \nArr[1] = 2, Arr[max] = 5. So the elements are [2,3,4,5], Arr[max] = 5. The elements within constraint are [2, 5, 3]. n - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1.\nThen we return 1."
