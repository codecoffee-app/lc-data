But you don&#39;t like an array having a large difference among numbers. To reduce the difference, you are going to perform the following operations on the array.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Remove an element from the start of the array.\nRemove an element from the end of the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-one-operation-you-can-remove-only-one-element-either-from-the-start-or-from-the-end-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-number-of-operations-after-which-array-a-holds-the-following-property\">In one operation, you can remove only one element, either from the start or from the end. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations, after which array &#39;A&#39; holds the following property -</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2 * min &gt; max\nWhere &#39;min&#39; is the minimum element of the array, and &#39;max&#39; is the maximum element of the array, calculated each time for the updated array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-can-perform-any-operations-of-your-choice-but-minimize-the-number-of-operations-and-return-it\">You can perform any operations of your choice, but minimize the number of operations and return it.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of tests.\n For each Test :\n     The first line contains an integer &#39;N&#39;, denoting the length of the array &#39;A&#39;.\n     The second line contains an array &#39;A&#39; of length &#39;N&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test, print an integer, denoting the minimum number of operations required such that the given condition holds true.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output.

The updated array is [4, 5] for which (2*min &gt; max) holds true, where &#39;min&#39; = 4 and &#39;max&#39; = 5.\n    One more way to perform operations is removing elements [4, 5]. But the number of operations cannot be less than 2. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nFor Case 2:\n    The given array already holds the required condition. Hence no need to perform any operations, and answer becomes 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5\n4 3 2 1 3\n3\n2 2 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n0\n</code></pre>\n",
