The number of units it moves in a move is equal to the move number. That is: it moves exactly one unit in move - 1, exactly two units in move - 2 and exactly ten units in move - 10.

Note that moving 1 unit to right, then 2 units to left and then 3 units to the right will also end up at position 3, but here the moves required are equal to three and a more optimal solution using two moves exists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1\n4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n3\n</code></pre>\n",
