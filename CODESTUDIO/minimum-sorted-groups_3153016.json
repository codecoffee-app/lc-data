Therefore we will print 2.\n\nNote that a group like { 1, 2, 3, 5 } can\u2019t be formed as it doesn\u2019t have relative ordering the same as the input array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; integers \u2018ARR\u2019, denoting the array elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the count of minimum groups that need to be formed.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
