Here, count of prime less than 5 is 2, next prime after 5 is 7. then apply special move (2+(7-5) = 4). So 5->4. Now the path is not correct so the correct explanation is: The optimal path is 1 -> 3 -> 5 (special move) -> 9 -> 10. The steps are:\n\n1 -> 3 (1 step)\n3 -> 5 (1 step)\n5 -> 9 (special move). Since 5 is a prime, there are 2 primes before it (2 and 3). The next prime after 5 is 7. Thus, the special move takes you to 2 + (7 - 5) = 4.  Since the special move result is a single digit, and we wish to find the shortest path, we can make this jump 5->9\n9 -> 10 (1 step)\nHence the number of steps is 4."

Here, count of prime less than 7 is 3, next prime after 7 is 11. then apply special move (3+(11-7) = 7). So 7->7, this doesn't help, so other path is: The optimal path is 1 -> 3 -> 5 (special move) -> 9 -> 11->13->14 The steps are:\n\n1 -> 3 (1 step)\n3 -> 5 (1 step)\n5 -> 9 (special move).\n9->11(1 step)\n11->13 (1 step)\n13 -> 14 (1 step)\nHence the number of steps is 6.
