Now, the ninja wants to show this plane to his best friend, whose house lies at point (X, 0) on the x-axis. There are multiple airports on the x-axis marked by 1. If there is no airport at any point, then it is marked as 0.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-an-integer-array-airports-of-size-n-containing-the-information-about-airports-on-the-x-axis-can-you-find-the-minimum-number-of-stops-that-must-be-taken-by-the-plane-to-reach-the-destination-x-0-on-the-x-axis-if-the-destination-is-unreachable-return-1-the-plane-starts-from-the-origin-0-0\">Given an integer array \u2018AIRPORTS\u2019 of size \u2018N\u2019 containing the information about airports on the x-axis, can you find the minimum number of stops that must be taken by the plane to reach the destination (X,0) on the x-axis. If the destination is unreachable, return -1. The plane starts from the origin (0, 0).</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given AIRPORTS = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], \u2018K\u2019 = 2 and \u2018X\u2019 = 4.\nThe answer will be 1. The plane makes its first stop at (2, 0) and then reaches the destination (4, 0) in the next fight. Hence the total number of stops is 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018K\u2019, \u2019X\u2019, representing the length of the \u2018AIRPORTS\u2019 array, maximum distance covered by plane in one flight, and destination on the x-axis, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, representing the information about the airports on the x-axis.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the minimum number of stops that must be taken by the plane to reach the destination (X,0) on the x-axis.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10 \n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000\n1 &lt;= K &lt; N \n1 &lt;= X &lt; N\n0 &lt;= AIRPORTS[i] &lt;= 1\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to input or print anything, as it has already been taken care of.

The plane makes its first stop at (2, 0) and then reaches the destination (4, 0) in the next fight. Hence the total number of stops is 1.\n\nFor the second test case, the answer will be 0. The plane can directly reach the destination without making any stop. Hence the total number of stops is 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 2 3\n1 0 0 1\n5 3 2\n1 0 1 0 0 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>-1\n0\n</code></pre>\n",
