You can swap any two adjacent elements. Your task is to find the minimum number of swaps such that the 0 are shifted to one side, and 1 shifted to the other.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the given array \u2018arr\u2019 = {1,0,1,1} we can swap the first and second elements, and all 1s will be shifted to the right side and 0s to the left side. Hence a minimum number of operations required is 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code> For each test case, print the minimum number of swaps required to arrange 0 to one side and 1 to the other side.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
