You need \u2018workers\u2019 to build the \u2018blocks\u2019, and a block can only be built by exactly one worker (means once a worker assigned to a particular block he needs to finish it). A worker can either split into two workers or build a block then go home. There is an extra time cost associated with both of the operations.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-array-block-where-block-i-denotes-the-time-required-to-build-the-ith-block-you-are-also-given-an-integer-split-which-denotes-the-time-required-to-split-the-worker-the-process-starts-with-only-one-worker-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-time-required-to-build-all-the-blocks\">You are given an array \u2018BLOCK\u2019 where \u2018BLOCK[i]\u2019 denotes the time required to build the ith block. You are also given an integer, \u2018SPLIT\u2019, which denotes the time required to split the worker. The process starts with only one worker.
