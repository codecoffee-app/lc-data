You need \u2018workers\u2019 to build the \u2018blocks\u2019, and a block can only be built by exactly one worker (means once a worker assigned to a particular block he needs to finish it). A worker can either split into two workers or build a block then go home. There is an extra time cost associated with both of the operations.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-array-block-where-block-i-denotes-the-time-required-to-build-the-ith-block-you-are-also-given-an-integer-split-which-denotes-the-time-required-to-split-the-worker-the-process-starts-with-only-one-worker-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-time-required-to-build-all-the-blocks\">You are given an array \u2018BLOCK\u2019 where \u2018BLOCK[i]\u2019 denotes the time required to build the ith block.

Total time = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3=4.  Correct explanation should be One worker splits into two (cost 1). Worker 1 builds block 1 in 1 unit of time. Then, worker 2 splits into two (cost 1). Worker 2 and worker 3 will build block 2 and 3 repectively.  Total time = 1 + max(1, 1+2, 1+3) = 1 + max(1, 3, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5. The optimal way is worker split and worker build block 1. then the second worker split, each other worker takes building other blocks. split(1) + max(block[0], split(1) + block[1], split(1) + block[2]). In this case split(1) + max(1, 1+2, 1+3) = 1 + 4 = 5"

Actually total time = split(2) + max(split(2) + block[0], split(2) + block[1], split(2) + block[2], block[3]). In this case split(2) + max(2+5, 2+2, 2+1, 8) = 2 + max(7, 4, 3, 8) = 2 + 8 = 10. The right solution must be start with one worker -> split into 2 workers(cost=2). split one of the two workers again -> now we have 3 workers and cost=2. split one of the three workers now we have 4 workers -> cost =2. assign one worker to each block. cost=max(5,2,1,8). so total = 2+2+2+8=14"
