He wants to reach Ninjaland as soon as possible. Mr. X&#39;s house and Ninjaland are connected by a straight road having two parallel lanes. Let the two lanes be Lane-0 and Lane-1. He can start from any of the two lanes, and during the course of the journey, he can switch between the two lanes. There are a total of &#39;N+1&#39; checkpoints on the road. Let the checkpoints be numbered from 0 to &#39;N&#39;. Mr. X, is currently at Checkpoint 0 and Ninjaland is at checkpoint &#39;N&#39;. Note that, it is only possible to switch between the lanes when the car is present at a checkpoint.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-time-it-takes-to-move-between-two-consecutive-checkpoints-is-given-in-the-2d-matrix-time-having-n-rows-and-2-columns-time-i-j-denotes-the-time-it-takes-to-move-from-ith-checkpoint-to-the-i-1-th-checkpoint-by-traveling-through-lane-j\">The time it takes to move between two consecutive checkpoints is given in the 2D Matrix &#39;TIME&#39; having &#39;N&#39; rows and 2 columns. &#39;TIME[i][j]&#39; denotes the time it takes to move from &#39;i&#39;th&#39; checkpoint to the &#39;(i+1)&#39;th&#39; checkpoint by traveling through Lane - j.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-time-it-takes-to-switch-lanes-at-checkpoints-is-given-in-the-2d-matrix-checkpoints-having-n-1-rows-and-2-columns-if-mr-x-switches-from-lane-0-to-lane-1-at-checkpoint-i-1-then-he-reaches-lane-1-at-checkpoint-i-2-and-it-takes-checkpoints-i-0-time-to-complete-the-switch-similarly-when-he-switches-from-lane-1-to-lane-0-at-checkpoint-i-1-he-reaches-lane-0-at-checkpoint-i-2-and-it-takes-checkpoints-i-1-time-to-complete-the-switch-note-that-it-is-not-possible-to-switch-lanes-at-checkpoint-0-and-checkpoint-n\">The time it takes to switch lanes at checkpoints is given in the 2D Matrix &#39;CHECKPOINTS&#39; having &#39;N-1&#39; rows and 2 columns.
