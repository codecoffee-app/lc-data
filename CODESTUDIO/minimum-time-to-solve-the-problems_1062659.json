Each problem takes 1 unit of time to be solved. Also, you have &#39;K&#39; friends, and you want to assign the subjects to each friend such that each subject is assigned to exactly one friend. Also, the assignment of subjects should be contiguous. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of problems allocated to a friend is minimum.
