You are given an array \u2018POINTS\u2019 containing \u2018N\u2019 such points. Ninja lives at the location \u2018POINTS[0]\u2019 and wants to visit all the remaining \u2018N-1\u2019 points in the order given by the \u2018POINTS\u2019 array. Your task is to help ninja find the minimum time (in seconds) required to visit all the points in the given order (starting from \u2018POINTS[0]\u2019).</h4>\n\n<h5> The ninja can travel according to the following rules :\n\n</br>\n\n<ul><li>In one second, the ninja can either:<ul><li>Move vertically by one unit, i.e., along the y-direction.</li><li>Move horizontally by one unit, i.e., along the x-direction.</li><li>Move diagonally by \u2018sqrt(2)\u2019 units, i.e., move one unit horizontally then one unit vertically.</li></ul><li>The ninja must visit the points in the exact order as they are given the \u2018POINTS\u2019 array.</li><li>The ninja is allowed to pass through points that may be given later in the order, but these points will not be counted as visited.</li></ul></h5>\n\n<p></br></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018POINTS = [ [3, 1], [-1, 3], [2, 0] ]\u2019, \u2018N = 3\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/example-9466.png\" alt=\"Example\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>The path with minimum time is: \u2018[3,1] -&gt; [2,2] -&gt; [1,3] - &gt; [0,3] -&gt; [-1,3] -&gt; [0,2] -&gt; [1,1] -&gt; [2,0]\u2019.\n\nTime taken from [3,1] to [-1,3] = 4 seconds.\nTime taken from [-1,3] to [2,0] = 3 seconds.\n\nTotal time = 7 seconds.
