Ninja Land has &#39;N&#39; cities numbered from 1 to &#39;N&#39; and &#39;M&#39; bidirectional roads. Each road connects two of the &#39;N&#39; cities, and no two cities have multiple roads between them. Mr. X wants to visit all the &#39;M&#39; roads and &#39;N&#39; cities of Ninja land. To do so, he can arbitrarily select any city as the starting city, travel through all the roads, and should end his journey in the same city which he selected as the starting city.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-the-description-of-each-of-the-m-roads-i-e-the-two-2-cities-that-the-road-connects-and-the-time-it-takes-to-travel-between-the-two-cities-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-time-that-mr-x-will-take-to-visit-all-the-roads-satisfying-the-above-conditions\">Given the description of each of the &#39;M&#39; roads i.e, the two 2 cities that the road connects, and the time it takes to travel between the two cities.
