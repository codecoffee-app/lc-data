You can pick any subset of \u2018K\u2019 numbers from the array/list. The task is to find the minimum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum value in the subset.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider an array of size six. The elements of the array are { 6, 4, 3, 5, 5, 1 }, and the value of \u2018K\u2019 is 3. \nIf we select {1, 3, 6}, the output will be the difference of the maximum of (1, 3, 6) and the minimum of (1,3, 6), i.e. 5. \nIf we select {4, 5, 5}, the output will be the difference of the maximum of (4, 5,  5) and the minimum of (4, 5, 5), i.e. 1.\nAmong all such possible values, 1 is the minimum, and hence, it is the correct output.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of every test case contains two integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 denoting the size of the array/list and the number of elements in the subset, respectively. \n\nThe second line of every test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case, return the minimum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum value in the subset of size \u2018K\u2019. \n\nThe output of each test case is printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
