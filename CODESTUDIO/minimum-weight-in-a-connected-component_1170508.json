Your task is to find out the number of connected components, the starting and ending node of each component, and the minimum weight in that component.

The starting and ending node of one component is 1 and 3, respectively, and the minimum weight in this component is 9. The starting and ending node in the other component is 4 and 5 respectively, and the minimum weight is 11.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39;, which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, denoting the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph, respectively.\n\nThen M lines follow. Each line contains three space-separated integers denoting the source, destination, and weight of each edge.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the number of connected components. Let\u2019s denote this as C. Then C lines follow. \n\nEach line contains three space-separated integers representing each component\u2019s starting and ending node and the minimum weight in that component.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of.
