You need to find all numbers that are in the range of the elements of the array, but not in the array. The missing elements should be printed in sorted order.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the given array is [4, 2, 9] then you should print &quot;3 5 6 7 8&quot;. As all these elements lie in the range but not present in the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of input contains an integer &#39;N&#39;  representing the length of the array.\n\nThe next line contains &#39;N&#39; single space-separated integers representing elements of the array &#39;ARR&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the list of elements that are not in the array &#39;ARR&#39;.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of.
