She has \u2018N\u2019 potions in front of her lying in a row. Her task is to combine these potions into 1. To do so, she can pick any two adjacent potions of color \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and mix them to form another potion of color \u2018C\u2019=(\u2018A\u2019 + \u2018B\u2019)%100, which will then replace \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 in the row (Two potions combine to form one potion). But when a new potion is formed, it produces smoke of value \u2018A\u2019 * \u2018B\u2019.  Hermione needs your help to minimize the smoke produced in the above task.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For the given array [ 1, 3, 1, 2, 4 ].\n\nThe optimal way will be:\n\nMix the last two elements.
