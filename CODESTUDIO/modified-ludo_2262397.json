In a single turn, you can roll a standard six-sided dice and move to a position i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4, i+5, or i+6 from your current position 'i'. Additionally, there are 'M' connections on the board represented by the 'connections' array. If 'connections[i][0]' is your current position, you can directly move to 'connections[i][1]' without rolling the dice (this move doesn't count as a dice roll).
