Your task is to modify the tree so that all its nodes have values in the range  [\u2018LOW\u2019, \u2018HIGH\u2019] inclusive.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"modifying-the-tree-should-not-change-the-relative-structure-of-the-nodes-that-will-remain-in-the-tree-i-e-any-nodes-descendant-should-remain-a-descendant-there-will-always-be-a-unique-answer\">Modifying the tree should not change the relative structure of the nodes that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node&#39;s descendant should remain a descendant). There will always be a unique answer.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-that-the-root-may-change-depending-on-the-given-bounds\">Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-for-low-3-and-high-6-see-the-below-picture-for-reference\">For example: For \u2018LOW\u2019 = 3 and \u2018HIGH\u2019 = 6 see the below picture for reference:</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/dfg-8290.JPG\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>As we can see 0 is not in the range [3, 6] so we delete this node from the \u2018TREE\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; representing the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers \u2018LOW\u2019 and \u2018HIGH\u2019.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains elements in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/bsttominheap-6482.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>4\n2 6\n1 3 5 7\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 4\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 4 = 2\nRight child of 4 = 6\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 1\nRight child of 2 = 3\nLeft child of 6 = 5\nRight child of 6 = 7\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 1 = null (-1)\nRight child of 1 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = null (-1)\nRight child of 3 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \n\nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n\n4 2 6 1 3 5 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the modified tree after trimming in the level order form.\n\nThe output for each test case is printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
