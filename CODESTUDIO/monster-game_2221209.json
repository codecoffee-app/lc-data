Each monster has power \u2018P\u2019 associated with it. Each monster follows (\u2018P\u2019 * \u2018P\u2019 + 1) % \u2018M\u2019 distinct monsters in the next level having values from 0 to [(\u2018P\u2019 * \u2018P\u2019 + 1) % \u2018M\u2019] - 1 where \u2018M\u2019 is a modulo integer given to you. Find the total number of monsters in all levels you need to finish to clear the game.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>In the first level, there is only one monster with power, \u2018P\u2019 = 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 representing the number of levels and the modulo integer respectively.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer modulo \u2018M\u2019 representing the number of monsters. \n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

So the number of monster in next level will be ((2 * 2) + 1) % 4 i.e. 5 % 4 = 1. And the power of next level monster will be from 0 to [((2 * 2) + 1) % 4] - 1 i.e. 0 to 0.\nLevel 2: The number of monsters is 1 with power 0. \nWe reached the last level, so the total number of monsters will be 2.\n\nFor second test case :\n\nAs there is only 1 level present, so the number of monsters will be 1. \n</code></pre>\n",
