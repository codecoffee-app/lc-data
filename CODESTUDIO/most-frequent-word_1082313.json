You have also given a list of banned words. Now your task is to find the most frequent word which is not in the list of banned words. There will always be a solution, and the solution will be unique.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"while-comparing-words-you-can-ignore-whether-the-letter-is-lowercase-or-uppercase-for-example-ask-and-ask-are-the-same-the-words-will-always-contain-only-alphabets-or-we-can-say-words-will-be-separated-by-spaces-or-punctuation-the-answer-will-be-in-uppercase-letters\">While comparing words, you can ignore whether the letter is lowercase or uppercase. For example, \u2018AsK\u2019 and \u2018aSK\u2019 are the same. The words will always contain only alphabets or we can say words will be separated by spaces or punctuation. The answer will be in uppercase letters.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-words-in-the-banned-list-will-always-be-in-upper-letters-and-free-from-punctuation-and-spaces\">The words in the banned list will always be in upper letters and free from punctuation and spaces.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Paragraph = \u2018It&#39;s a square SqUare. It&#39;s a FLAT flat.\u2019 \nBanned =[FLAT, IT, S]. \nSo we can see these words [IT, S, SQUARE, FLAT ]  are most frequent.\nNow we will look at to banned list and we can see 3 of the words are banned.\nSo we have a unique answer SQUARE which has a frequency of 2 and not on the banned list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a string PARAGRAPH.\nThe second line of input contains an integer &#39;N&#39; representing the size of the banned words list.\nThe third line of input contains &#39;N&#39; space-separated words BANNEDWORDS.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Print the word (in UPPERCASE) which is most frequent and is not present in the list of banned words.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t have to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1&lt;= N &lt;=10^6\n1&lt;=banned.size&lt;=100\nWhere \u2018N\u2019 is the size of paragraph.\n\nTime limit: 1 second\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Smile, smile, smile at your mind as often as possible.\n3\nYOUR MIND POSSIBLE\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample output 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>SMILE\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation for sample output 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>We can see \u2018SMILE\u2019 occurs 3 times and all other words occur 1 time except \u2018AS\u2019 which appears 2 times. So \u2018SMILE\u2019 is the most frequent word and it is not on the banned list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample input 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The sad truth is that the truth is sad.\n4\nTHE THAT IS TRUTH\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample output 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>SAD\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-2\">Explanation for sample output 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>In the paragraph, we have a total of 9 words and 4 of them appear twice which are [SAD, THE, IS, TRUTH].
