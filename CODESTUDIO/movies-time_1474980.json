Due to lockdown everywhere, they have enough time to see movies together. So they decided to rent the movies online to watch them.

So they decided to watch it separately.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"they-choose-n-movies-to-watch-the-duration-of-each-movie-is-given-in-a-list-of-movies-they-want-to-finish-the-set-of-n-movies-as-soon-as-possible-you-have-to-find-the-minimum-time-they-need-to-watch-n-movies-if-both-cannot-watch-the-same-movie-at-the-same-time\">They choose \u2018N\u2019 movies to watch. The duration of each movie is given in a list of \u2018MOVIES\u2019. They want to finish the set of \u2018N\u2019 movies as soon as possible.

So it will take 8 minutes as both are watching simultaneously, then this process will be reversed. So it takes a total of 8+8 = 16 minutes.\n\nIn the second test case Bucky will watch movies in the order 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 and Steve will watch movies in the order 3 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2. When Bucky will end his 3rd movie then Steve\u2019s movie will also be finished.\nSo the answer will be 2+3+4 = 9.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n7 6 4\n4\n1 4 2 6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>17\n13\n</code></pre>\n",
