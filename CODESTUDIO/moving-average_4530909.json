Its value can change multiple times in a fraction of a second or remain unchanged for several minutes. Analysing the dynamics of stock price change can provide an indication of a forthcoming uptrend or downtrend in that stock. One such indicator is simple moving averages. Now, Harry wants to analyse the price trend of the stock on the basis of moving averages (MA).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"let-s-consider-a-moving-average-of-2-day-and-4-day-respectively-a-2-day-moving-average-is-calculated-by-taking-an-average-of-the-closing-price-of-2-consecutive-days-a-4-day-moving-average-is-calculated-by-taking-an-average-closing-price-of-4-consecutive-days-now-according-to-experts-whenever-a-faster-moving-average-curve-2-day-ma-cuts-the-slower-moving-average-4-day-ma-from-below-then-it-is-an-indication-of-an-uptrend-in-the-stock-similarly-whenever-a-faster-moving-averages-curve-2-day-ma-cuts-the-slower-moving-average-curve-4-day-ma-from-above-then-it-is-an-indication-of-the-downtrend-in-the-stock\">Let\u2019s consider a moving average of 2-day and 4-day, respectively. A 2-day moving average is calculated by taking an average of the closing price of 2 consecutive days. A 4-day moving average is calculated by taking an average closing price of 4 consecutive days. Now, according to experts whenever a faster moving average curve (2-day MA) cuts the slower moving average (4-day MA) from below, then it is an indication of an uptrend in the stock. Similarly, whenever a faster-moving averages curve (2-day MA) cuts the slower moving average curve (4-day MA) from above, then it is an indication of the downtrend in the stock.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"help-harry-in-computing-the-number-of-uptrends-and-downtrends-in-the-given-time-for-which-the-data-is-provided\">Help Harry in computing the number of uptrends and downtrends in the given time for which the data is provided.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"part-df061eaa719a00dd\"><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/img-17127.png\" alt=\"\"></h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-this-graph-there-are-three-lines-indicating-stock-closing-price-moving-average-of-two-days-and-four-days-now-we-can-see-that-between-13th-and-15th-there-is-an-intersection-it-is-known-as-a-downtrend-when-the-moving-average-of-fewer-days-is-cut-downwards-the-more-days-moving-average-and-vice-versa\">In this graph, there are three lines indicating stock closing price, moving average of two days and four days.

Analyzing these price movements can offer insights into upcoming uptrends or downtrends. One common indicator is the Simple Moving Average (SMA). This problem focuses on Harry's desire to analyze stock price trends using moving averages.  We will consider two moving averages: a faster X-day MA and a slower Y-day MA. An uptrend is indicated when the X-day MA crosses the Y-day MA from below. Conversely, a downtrend occurs when the X-day MA crosses the Y-day MA from above. The task is to help Harry calculate the number of uptrends and downtrends present in a given dataset of stock prices.",
