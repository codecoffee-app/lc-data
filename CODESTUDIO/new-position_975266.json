Assume numbers from 1 to \u2018N\u2019 are arranged such that all odd numbers (in ascending order) are present first and then come to all even numbers (also in ascending order).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-need-to-find-the-integer-at-position-k-numbering-of-positions-starts-from-1\">You need to find the integer at position \u2018K\u2019 (numbering of positions starts from 1).</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given \u2018N\u2019 as 7 and \u2018K\u2019 as 4.  Numbers from 1 to 7 are arranged as [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6], and the number at position 4 is 7.
