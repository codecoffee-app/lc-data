If it is not, then we rearrange the array; else, we keep it as it is. So we first rearrange positions of 2 and 3 and follow similar steps to rearrange the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the second test case, we traverse the array for every second element. As here 2 is less than its left element, so we do a rearrangement. Similarly, we rearrange the whole array.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n6\n9 7 1 2 9 6\n3\n3 2 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>##### Sample Output 2: \n     7 9 1 9 2 6\n     2 3 1</p>\n",
