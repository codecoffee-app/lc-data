There are \u2018N\u2019 jars filled with chocolates. His mother has gone to the market and will home come after \u2018M\u2019 minutes. The ninja can eat up to \u2018X\u2019 chocolates per minute. Every minute when his mother is not there, he chooses any jar and takes out \u2018X\u2019 chocolates from that jar, and eats them. If any jar has less than \u2018X\u2019 chocolates, then he eats all of the chocolates in that jar but won\u2019t eat any more chocolates during this minute. Your task is to print \u2018X\u2019 the minimum chocolate-eating speed of Ninja such that he eats all the chocolates within \u2018M\u2019 minutes before his mother comes back.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers &#39;N&#39; and &#39;M&#39;, the number of jars, and the minutes after which his mother comes back.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains &#39;N&#39; space-separated integers, the number of chocolates present in &#39;N&#39; jars.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case, the only line of output should contain an integer &#39;X&#39;, the minimum chocolate-eating speed of Ninja as described in the problem statement. \n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

There are many ways in which he can eat these chocolates. One such way is that he takes 3 minutes to eat all the chocolates(5) from 1st Jar, 2 minutes to eat all the chocolates(4) from the 2nd Jar,  2 minutes to eat all the chocolates(3) from 3rd Jar, and finally, take 1 minute to eat all the chocolates from the final jar which has 2 chocolates. The total time taken will be 3+2+2+1 = 8 which is less than 10.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n5 5\n3 9 3 4 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-2\">Explanation of Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If Ninja eats at a speed of 9 chocolates per minute, he can finish before his mother comes back. One such way is that he can start eating chocolates from the 2nd jar and take 1 minute to eat all the 9 chocolates from that jar and 1 minute each for all other jars since each jar has less than 9 chocolates. Hence, the total time will be 1+1+1+1+1 = 5, which is just in time.\n</code></pre>\n",
