There are a total of N fruits where each fruit is labelled with a unique id from 0 to N-1. The fruits are placed in a few boxes and you are given the pairs of fruit ids, where each pair is made up of fruits which are placed in the same box.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-wants-to-eat-only-those-fruits-which-are-placed-in-different-boxes-can-you-find-the-number-of-ways-ninja-can-select-two-fruits-which-belong-to-different-boxes\">Ninja wants to eat only those fruits which are placed in different boxes. Can you find the number of ways Ninja can select two fruits which belong to different boxes?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let the number of fruits be 4 i.e. N = 4 and the list of pair of fruit ids be { [0, 2], [2, 3] }. From the given list we can say that there are 2 boxes of fruits: [0, 2, 3] and [1]. Therefore Ninja can select two fruits which belong to different boxes as [1, 0], [1, 2], and [1, 3] i.e. a total of 3 ways.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The very first line of input contains an integer T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of every test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 denoting the number of fruits and the number of pairs of fruit ids in the list, respectively.\n\nEach of the next \u2018M\u2019 lines contains two space-separated integers \u2018u\u2019 and \u2018v\u2019 denoting the pairs of fruit ids of the fruits which are placed in the same box.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the number of ways Ninja can select two fruits that belong to different boxes.\n\nOutput for each test case is printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just return the number of ways. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10 \n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 5 * 10^4\n1 &lt;= M &lt; N-1\n0 &lt;= Fruit ID &lt;= N-1\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n\nWhere  \u2018T\u2019 represents the number of test cases and \u2018N\u2019 represents the number of fruits and \u2018M\u2019 represents the number of pairs of fruit ids in the list.\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 2\n0 2\n2 3\n5 3\n0 1\n3 2\n1 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-1\">Explanation 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case refer to the example explained above.\n\nFor the second test case we have, the number of fruits, N = 5 and the list of pair of fruit ids is { [0, 1], [3, 2], [1, 4] }. From the given list we can say that there are 2 boxes of fruits: [0, 1, 4] and [2, 3]. Therefore Ninja can select two fruits which belong to different boxes as [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [4, 2], and [4, 3] i.e. a total of 6 ways.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 1\n1 3\n6 2\n0 2\n3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n13\n</code></pre>\n",
