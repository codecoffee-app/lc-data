He has not studied well for it. So, he decided to get only the passing marks. Ninja knows that the exam will consist of three types of questions, having marks 2, 5 and 7 respectively. He needs to find the number of ways he can achieve passing marks in the exam by attempting those questions. He asked you to help him with this as he is busy preparing. So, you need to find out the number of ways he can score the passing marks.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let us suppose the passing marks is: 10\nSo, the number of ways Ninja can score 10 marks are (2, 2, 2, 2, 2) and (5, 5), so you need to print 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Keep in mind that a particular test has infinite questions of each type.\nKeep in mind that the ninja does not want more than the passing marks.\nPlease note that (2, 5) and (5, 2) are the same and you need to take them as a single way.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case will contain a single integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the passing marks of the test.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer that denotes the number of ways to reach the given marks.\n\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50\n0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
