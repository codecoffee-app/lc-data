He got an interview call from MIT. During the interview, the professor asked Ninja a challenging question.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-two-integers-n1-and-n2-the-professor-asked-ninja-to-find-the-fraction-when-the-first-number-i-e-n1-is-divided-by-the-second-number-i-e-n2-if-the-fractional-part-is-repeating-then-the-repeating-part-should-be-enclosed-in-parentheses\">Given two integers &#39;N1&#39; and &#39;N2&#39;, the professor asked Ninja to find the fraction when the first number i.e &#39;N1&#39; is divided by the second number i.e &#39;N2&#39;. If the fractional part is repeating, then the repeating part should be enclosed in parentheses.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-if-n1-is-1-and-n2-is-3-and-when-we-divide-1-by-3-i-e-1-3-the-answer-is-0-333-here-3-is-repeated-infinite-times-because-the-remainder-never-becomes-zero-in-this-problem-as-we-know-the-fractional-part-i-e-3-is-repeating-so-we-have-to-enclose-the-repeating-part-in-parentheses-therefore-the-answer-is-0-3\">For example, if &#39;N1&#39; is 1 and &#39;N2&#39; is 3 and when we divide 1 by 3 i.e 1/3, the answer is 0.333...  Here 3 is repeated infinite times because the remainder never becomes zero in this problem. As we know the fractional part ( i.e 3 ) is repeating, so we have to enclose the repeating part in parentheses. Therefore, the answer is \u201c0.(3)\u201d.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-is-stuck-in-this-problem-can-you-help-ninja-to-crack-this-interview-and-get-admission-in-mit\">Ninja is stuck in this problem.

After that, the remainder becomes zero so we stop the further division. So the answer to this sample test case is \u201c0.5\u201d.\n\nIn test case 2, When we divide 2 by 3 i.e 2/3, the answer is 0.666...  Here 6 is repeated infinite times because the remainder never becomes zero in this problem. As we know the fractional part ( i.e 6 ) is repeating, so we have to enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

So, the answer to this sample test case is \u201c2\u201d.\n\nIn test case 2, When we divide -1 by 6 i.e -1/6 the answer is -0.16666...  Here 6 is repeated infinite times because the remainder never becomes zero in this division. As we know the fractional part ( i.e 6 ) is repeating, so we have to enclose the repeating part in parentheses. So the answer to this sample test case is \u201c-0.1(6)\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n",
