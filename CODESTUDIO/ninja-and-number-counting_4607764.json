He has been provided with two numbers \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 which represent the range, Both numbers are inclusive. He has been provided with two more numbers which are \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 and now he has to do find the following :</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"what-is-the-count-of-numbers-in-the-range-l-r-in-which-each-number-has-digit-d-exactly-k-times\">What is the count of numbers in the range [L, R] in which each number has digit \u2018D\u2019 exactly \u2018K\u2019 times?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: \u2018L\u2019 = 1, \u2018R\u2019 = 12, \u2018D\u2019 = 2, \u2018K\u2019 = 1 \n\nOutput: 2\n\nAs in the range, numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 2, 12 are the numbers where the digit \u20182\u2019 comes exactly once.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line will contain the integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 the left and right boundaries of the range.\nThe second line contains \u2018D\u2019 the digit for which we have to check.\nThe third line contains &#39;K&#39; the count of the digit &#39;D&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the count of numbers satisfying the given criteria.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything.
