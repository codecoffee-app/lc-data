He has to find the product of the numbers and store it in A. Then he has to perform GCD of the numbers and store it in B. Finally, he has to return A power B.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"since-the-answer-can-be-large-return-answer-modulus-10-9-7\">Since the answer can be large, return answer modulus 10^9 + 7.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019, denoting the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains the array elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first and only line of each test case contains a number returned after performing the required operations.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of.
