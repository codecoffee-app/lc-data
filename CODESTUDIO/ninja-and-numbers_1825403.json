His friend is helping him learn by giving him problems to solve. He gives him a tree with N nodes numbered from 0 to N - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of the ith node. The root of the tree is node 0. Now Ninja has to find the kth ancestor of a given node. The kth ancestor of a tree node is the kth node in the path from that node to the root node.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a positive integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the number of nodes.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains the parent array.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains a node value and k value.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first and only line of each test case contains an integer denoting the kth ancestor.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of.
