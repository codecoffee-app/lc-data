You are also given an integer \u2018K\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-thinks-that-a-number-is-stable-if-the-following-condition-is-satisfied\">Ninja thinks that a number is stable if the following condition is satisfied:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-every-ith-digit-where-0-i-b-1-s-i-s-i-k-here-x-y-represents-the-modulo-operations-the-remainder-when-x-is-divided-by-y\">For every \u2018ith\u2019 digit where (0 &lt;= \u2018i\u2019 &lt;= \u2018B-1\u2019) \u2018S[i] = S[i%K]\u2019. Here, \u2018X%Y\u2019 represents the modulo operations. The remainder when \u2018X\u2019 is divided by \u2018Y\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-smallest-number-which-is-stable-and-whose-value-is-greater-than-or-equal-to-a-zero-based-indexing-is-used-everywhere\">Your task is to find the smallest number which is stable and whose value is greater than or equal to \u2018A\u2019. Zero-based indexing is used everywhere.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018B\u2019 = 4, \u2018S\u2019 = \u201c4321\u201d, \u2018K\u2019 = 3.\nThe given number is not stable as \u2018S[3]\u2019 is not the same as \u2018S[0]\u2019 but 3%3 = 0 same as 0%3. \u2018S[3] = 1\u2019 and \u2018S[0] = 4\u2019.  But the number \u201c4324\u201d is stable. As, for all \u2018i\u2019, \u2018S[i]\u2019 = \u2018S[i%K]\u2019 and \u201c4324\u201d is also greater than the given number. It can be proved that this is the best possible answer.\nHence, the answer is \u201c4324\u201d.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then the test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two single space-separated integers, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018K&#39;.\nThe second line contains a string with \u2018B\u2019 characters representing the string \u2018S\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the minimum stable number whose value is the same or exceeds the value of \u2018A\u2019.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 B \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^9\nIt\u2019s guaranteed that sum of \u2018B\u2019 over all cases does not exceed 10^5. \nThe given number will not contain leading zeros.\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 2\n6825\n3 3\n420\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>6868\n420\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For test case 1: \n6868 is the minimum possible, stable number. We can see that it is stable because \u2018S[0] = S[2]\u2019 because 0%2 = 2%2, and \u2018S[1] = S[3]\u2019 because 1%2 = 3%2. All the conditions are satisfied.\nHence, 6868 is the answer.\n\nFor test case 2:\nThe given number itself is stable, and hence it is the best possible answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5 1\n40369\n4 2\n8516\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>44444\n8585\n</code></pre>\n",
