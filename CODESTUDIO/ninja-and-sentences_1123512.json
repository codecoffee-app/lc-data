Ninja is stuck at a particular phase where he wants the robot to create all possible sentences from a 2D array of words. Help Ninja in solving this problem. For a given 2D array of words, your task is to create all possible sentences that can be made using them.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In a particular sentence, the robot can use a single word from the row that the word is part of.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\nThen the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019 , the rows and columns of the 2D array that contains the list of words. \nThe next \u2018N\u2019 lines contain \u2018M\u2019 strings each.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, all the possible sentences formed are printed in a separate line.\nThe output of each test case is printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The output format is predefined for this question. You need to store all possibly created sentences in a predefined data structure.
