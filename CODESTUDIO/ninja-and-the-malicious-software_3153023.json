The network is represented by an N x N adjacency matrix GRAPH, where GRAPH[i][j] = 1 indicates a direct connection between computer i and computer j. Initially, a subset of computers, INFECTED, are infected. The malware spreads through connected computers: if an infected computer is connected to an uninfected computer, the uninfected computer becomes infected. This spread continues until no more computers can be infected.\n\nNinja, the CSO of NinjaWorks, aims to minimize the malware's impact by removing exactly one computer from the initially infected set (INFECTED). Your task is to determine which computer to remove to minimize the total number of infected computers after the spread completes. If multiple computers achieve the same minimum, return the computer with the smallest index.",
