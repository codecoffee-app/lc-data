Now, he is stuck in the maze. He can go in any direction(Up, Down, Left, or Right) from this point, but he cannot change his direction of motion until he comes across a wall in its path. Once he stops, he can choose his new direction.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-you-are-given-ninja-s-starting-point-the-destination-he-wants-to-reach-and-the-maze-in-the-form-of-a-2d-matrix-you-need-to-find-out-if-ninja-can-reach-the-destination-from-the-starting-point-or-not\">Now, you are given Ninja\u2019s starting point, the destination he wants to reach, and the maze in the form of a 2D matrix.
