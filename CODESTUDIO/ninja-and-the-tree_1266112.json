While learning, she came across learn about the Binary Search tree. She found BST quite interesting. She decided to make her own Binary Search Tree. Being a newbie, she made a mistake and swap two nodes of the Binary Search Tree.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-responsibility-being-an-expert-and-a-good-friend-is-to-correct-the-binary-search-tree-made-by-ninja-and-recover-the-correct-binary-search-tree\">Your responsibility being an expert and a good friend is to correct the Binary Search Tree made by Ninja and recover the correct Binary Search Tree.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-binary-search-tree-bst-is-a-binary-tree-data-structure-with-the-following-properties\">A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure with the following properties.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>\u2022 The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node\u2019s data.\n\u2022 The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node\u2019s data.\n\u2022 Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example</h5>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-3-8457.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>This is the binary search tree made by Ninja. But here, the left node of 8 is greater, and the right node is smaller.\nIf we swap the right and the left node of 8 Ninja\u2019s Binary Search Tree will become correct.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-2-8458.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>This is the correct binary Search Tree.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an Integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\n\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Elements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/graph-4-8466.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\n\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \n\nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n\n1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the recovered correct Binary Search Tree in level order form.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
