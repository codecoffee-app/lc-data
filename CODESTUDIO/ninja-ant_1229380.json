The ant moves in an interesting way. If the ith row and jth column value are 1, it rotates 90 degrees in the right direction and moves 1 step forward. If the value at the ith row and jth column are 0, it rotates 90 degrees in the left direction and moves 1 step forward.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-final-coordinates-of-the-ant\">Your task is to find the final coordinates of the ant.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The ant initially faces toward the east side.

For each move, the ant's behavior depends on the value at its current cell: a value of 1 causes a 90-degree right rotation followed by a forward step, while a value of 0 results in a 90-degree left rotation and a forward step.  Each time the ant moves from a block, it inverts the value of the cell (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). Your task is to determine the ant's final coordinates after 'moves' steps. If the ant exits the matrix at any point, return [-1, -1].",
