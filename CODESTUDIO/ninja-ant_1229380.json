The ant moves in an interesting way. If the ith row and jth column value are 1, it rotates 90 degrees in the right direction and moves 1 step forward. If the value at the ith row and jth column are 0, it rotates 90 degrees in the left direction and moves 1 step forward.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-final-coordinates-of-the-ant\">Your task is to find the final coordinates of the ant.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The ant initially faces toward the east side.

Therefore output will be 1 0.\n\nFor the second test case:\nThe ant first takes a right turn and lands at (1,0). The ant takes a right turn and moves forward, coming to 1,1.
