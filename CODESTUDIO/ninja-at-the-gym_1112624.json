He decides to lift dumbbells to build muscles. The rack contains dumbbells with varying weights. His strategy is to pick a dumbbell randomly from the rack and after exercising place it back to its original position. Now for the next exercise he can only pick dumbbells that are heavier and positioned right to the previously used. After completing all the exercises he has to tell the sum of weights of all dumbbells he picked to his trainer.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-order-to-impress-his-trainer-he-wants-this-sum-to-be-as-maximum-as-possible-as-ninja-is-saving-energy-for-exercises-he-asks-you-to-help-him-choose-dumbbells-can-you-help-ninja-to-impress-his-trainer\">In order to impress his trainer he wants this sum to be as maximum as possible. As Ninja is saving energy for exercises, he asks you to help him choose dumbbells. Can you help Ninja to impress his trainer?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the \u2018RACK\u2019 contains dumbbells with weights [5, 1,  2, 8], then the possible ways to choose dumbbells according to the given conditions are: [ 5 ], [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 8 ], [ 5, 8 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2, 8 ], [ 2, 8 ].  Lifting dumbbells with weights [ 5, 8 ] gives the maximum sum of 13.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run.
