To make the competition interesting and fair, both the teams should have an equal number of members. As an organizer, Ninja got the task of making the two teams.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"there-are-some-conditions-for-creating-teams-for-each-competition-he-will-be-given-a-number-n-and-for-each-divisor-d-of-n-including-1-and-n-itself-he-will-add-a-member\">There are some conditions for creating teams. For each competition, he will be given a number \u2018N\u2019, and for each divisor \u2018D\u2019 of \u2018N\u2019 ( including 1 and \u2018N\u2019 itself ), he will add a member:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"1-to-the-first-team-if-d-is-even\">1) to the first team if \u2018D\u2019 is even.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"2-to-the-second-team-if-d-is-odd\">2) to the second team if \u2018D\u2019 is odd.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"since-ninja-is-very-busy-organizing-the-event-he-wants-you-to-help-him-with-the-task-your-task-is-to-tell-ninja-if-he-can-create-two-teams-with-an-equal-number-of-members\">Since Ninja is very busy organizing the event, he wants you to help him with the task. Your task is to tell  Ninja if he can create two teams with an equal number of members.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For \u2018N\u2019 = 10,\nThe divisors are:\n1, 2, 5, 10.\nThe first team will have two members corresponding to divisors 2 and 10.\nThe second team will have two members corresponding to divisors 1 and 5.\nSo, in this case, Ninja can make two teams.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases to run.\n\nThen the test case follows:\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number given to Ninja. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case print \u2018true\u2019 if Ninja can make two teams of equal members with the given \u2018N\u2019, else print \u2018false\u2019.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
