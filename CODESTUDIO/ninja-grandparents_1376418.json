Now Ninja asks for the family tree from his father. His family tree is in the form of a binary tree and each node ( or we can say a family member ) is mentioned with some integer. Now his father asks him to write a code so that he is able to calculate the sum of all child nodes with even grandparents, that is, the grandparents node with an even integer value.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"so-your-task-is-to-calculate-the-sum-of-values-of-all-nodes-that-have-even-valued-grandparents-grandparents-refer-to-the-parent-of-the-parent-node-or-we-can-say-the-two-levels-above-node-is-a-grandparent-node\">So your task is to calculate the sum of values of all nodes that have even valued grandparents.

Refer to the example below.\n\nExample :\n\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line.
