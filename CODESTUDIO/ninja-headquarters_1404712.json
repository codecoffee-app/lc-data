There are 'N' potential office locations, each with coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and an associated value 'val[i]'. Each office can provide services within a maximum distance called 'range'. The service offered by an office decreases with distance.  For a coordinate (X, Y), the services from the i-th office are calculated as floor(val[i] / (1 + dist)) if the distance 'dist' between (X, Y) and the office is less than or equal to 'range', and 0 otherwise. The goal is to find the coordinate (X, Y) that maximizes the total service offered by all offices. If multiple such coordinates exist, choose the lexicographically smallest one (prioritizing smaller X, then smaller Y).",
