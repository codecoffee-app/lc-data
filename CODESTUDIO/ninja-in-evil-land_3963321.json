In this land, there is only one bank, which offers \u2018N\u2019 savings plans (numbered 1 through \u2018N\u2019). The interest factors are given in form of array \u2018ARR\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"initially-ninja-has-1-coin-in-his-account-he-may-choose-bank-plans-for-as-long-as-he-wishes-in-any-order-each-plan-may-be-chosen-any-number-of-times-for-each-valid-i-whenever-ninja-chooses-the-i-th-savings-plan-the-number-of-coins-in-his-bank-account-gets-multiplied-by-the-interest-factor-arr-i-of-this-plan-whenever-he-chooses-this-plan-again-the-number-of-coins-is-multiplied-by-arr-i-again\">Initially, Ninja has 1 coin in his account. He may choose bank plans for as long as he wishes, in any order; each plan may be chosen any number of times. For each valid \u2018i\u2019, whenever Ninja chooses the i-th savings plan, the number of coins in his bank account gets multiplied by the interest factor \u2018ARR[i]\u2019 of this plan (whenever he chooses this plan again, the number of coins is multiplied by \u2018ARR[i]\u2019 again).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"since-the-bank-in-the-evil-land-is-evil-it-always-stores-the-number-of-coins-in-each-account-modulo-m-m-is-a-prime-number-you-need-to-remove-some-possibly-none-or-all-plans-in-such-a-way-that-ninja-s-account-may-not-ever-contain-an-amount-exactly-equal-to-f-which-is-given-in-input-find-the-minimum-number-of-plans-you-must-remove\">Since the bank in the evil land is evil, it always stores the number of coins in each account modulo \u2018M\u2019. (\u2018M\u2019 is a prime number). You need to remove some (possibly none or all) plans in such a way that Ninja\u2019s account may not ever contain an amount exactly equal to \u2018F\u2019 (which is given in input). Find the minimum number of plans you must remove.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let \u2018N\u2019 = 2, \u2018M\u2019 = 5, \u2018F\u2019 = 3 and \u2018ARR\u2019 = [2, 4].\nNinja\u2019s account can contain 3 coins ((2 * 4) % 5 = 3), if he chooses Plan 1 and Plan 2. It is enough to remove Plan 1 as he can then only multiply the number of coins in his account by 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39;, which denotes the number of test cases.\n\nThe next line contains three integers \u2018N\u2019, \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019 denoting the number of Plans, Modulo number and coins which Ninja\u2019s bank cannot contain.\n\nThe next line contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers representing an array of interest factors.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the minimum number of plans you must remove.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
