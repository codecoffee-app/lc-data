So if we consider surface area of all cube towers independently then it would be  \n(6 * (1^2) ) + (3 * 6 * (1^2) ) + (3 * 6 * (1^2) ) +  (3 * 6 * (1^2) ) = 60. \n\nBut here, the cube at \u201cgrid[0,0]\u201d is sharing the surface with cubes at \u201cgrid[0][1]\u201d and at \u201cgrid[1][0]\u201d. Similarly, other cubes also have surfaces glued together. After subtracting the glued area, the total surface area of the structure will be 32 units. \n\n\nIn the second test case, there are only 2 cubes towers placed together. Their surface area individually will be 2 * (6 * (1^2) ) = 12, but the topmost surface of the first cube and the bottom-most surface of the second cube is glued together and not will be considered in the total surface area, so the total surface area will be 2 * (6 * (1^2) ) - (2 * (1^2) ) = 10.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n1 4 3 5\n7 8 9 0\n1 0 3 0\n1 1 1 1\n1\n0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>128\n0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-2\">Explanation of sample input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the second test case, there is no cube in the grid, so the surface area is 0.\n</code></pre>\n",
