Somehow ninja manages to get the secret of his number. He comes to know that if he converts that number into binary and takes its complement and again converts it into decimal type he will get a lottery winning number of \u2018Chit fund\u2019 lottery.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"but-ninja-is-not-good-at-maths-so-he-is-very-sad-about-how-he-will-get-that-lottery-number-from-his-dream-s-number-so-help-our-ninja-in-getting-that-lottery-number\">But ninja is not good at maths so he is very sad about how he will get that lottery number from his dream\u2019s number. So help our ninja in getting that lottery number.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-convert-the-given-number-into-its-binary-form-then-take-its-complement-complement-of-a-binary-number-is-the-value-obtained-by-swapping-all-the-bits-i-e-if-1-is-present-you-swap-it-with-0-and-vice-versa-then-again-convert-it-into-its-decimal-representation\">Your task is to convert the given number into its binary form then take its complement ( Complement of a binary number is the value obtained by swapping all the bits i.e if \u20181\u2019 is present you swap it with \u20180\u2019 and vice versa ), then again convert it into its decimal representation.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the given number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the number after doing its complement.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

So now converting it into decimal we get \u20183\u2019 so it\u2019s our final answer.\n\nTest Case 2:\nFor the first test case, the given number is \u20186\u2019 so its binary representation is \u20181 1 0\u2019 after taking its complement it looks like \u20180 0 1\u2019.
