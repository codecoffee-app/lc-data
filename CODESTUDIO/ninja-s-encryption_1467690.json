This technique involves a series of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operations, analogous to calculating a factorial but with alternating operations.  Starting with 'n', perform the following operations iteratively with decreasing integers (n-1, n-2, ... , 1): multiply, divide, add, subtract, and repeat the sequence. Return the final encrypted value.",
