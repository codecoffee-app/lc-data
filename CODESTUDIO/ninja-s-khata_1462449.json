There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the \u2018KHATA\u2019. \n2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the \u2018KHATA\u2019. \n1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the \u2018KHATA\u2019, so this order is added to the \u2018KHATA\u2019. \n4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the \u2018KHATA\u2019. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the \u2018KHATA\u2019.
