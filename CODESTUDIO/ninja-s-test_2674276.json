The Ninja wants to get admission into FAANG. To get admission into FAANG, Ninja needs to clear its admission test, which is as follows:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-an-integer-array-arr-of-size-n-find-the-maximum-absolute-difference-between-the-nearest-left-and-the-right-smaller-element-of-every-element-in-arr-if-there-is-no-left-smaller-or-right-smaller-element-of-any-element-then-take-0-as-the-smaller-element\">Given an integer array \u2018ARR\u2019 of size \u2018N\u2019, find the maximum absolute difference between the nearest left and the right smaller element of every element in \u2018ARR\u2019.
