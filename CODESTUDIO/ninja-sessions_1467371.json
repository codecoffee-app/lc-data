Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, \u2018N\u2019, denoting the total number of sessions. Then \u2018N\u2019 lines follow. \n\nEach of these \u2018N\u2019 lines contains two space-separated integers, denoting the starting time and ending time of the \u2018ith\u2019 session.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the maximum number of sessions Ninja can attend.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

He can attend the first session, which starts at 1 and ends at 4. He can also attend the second session because this session starts at 6.
