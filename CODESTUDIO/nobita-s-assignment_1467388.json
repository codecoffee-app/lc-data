In this assignment, he has to solve a mathematical equation given in the form of a string &#39;S&#39;. The equation contains only \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018-\u2019 operators and a variable \u2018x\u2019. Nobita doesn\u2019t know how to solve the equation. So, he went to Doremon for help.  Doremon gives him a gadget for this. But as usual, Nobita didn\u2019t listen to the instructions to use that gadget.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"so-now-its-your-task-to-help-nobita-find-solutions-to-the-given-equation-or-if-there-is-no-solution-report-that-as-well\">So, now it&#39;s your task to help Nobita find solutions to the given equation, or if there is no solution, report that as well.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If there is no solution for the equation, return &quot;No solution.\u201d\n\nIf there is only one solution for the equation, return that solution for \u2018x.\u2019\n\nIf there are infinite solutions for the equation, return &quot;Infinite solutions.\u201d\n\n\u2018x\u2019 may or may not have coefficients associated with it.\n\n\u2018+\u2019, \u2018-\u2019, and \u2018x\u2019 can occur any number of times in the equation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe next \u2018T\u2019 lines contain a string \u2018S\u2019 representing the equation given to Nobita.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the value of \u2018x\u2019, and if the solution doesn\u2019t exist, then print \u201cNo solution,\u201d and if there are infinite solutions, then print \u201cInfinite solutions\u201d.\n\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50\n3 &lt;= |S| &lt;= 10^7\n-100 &lt;= y &lt;= 100\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nx+4=5\nx=x\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\nInfinite solutions\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In test case 1, after shifting 4 from LHS to RHS equation becomes \u201cx = 5 - 4\u201d for which\n\u201cx = 1.\u201d\n\nIn test case 2, there are infinite values possible for which \u2018x\u2019 will be equal to \u2018x\u2019.
