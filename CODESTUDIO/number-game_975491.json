The rules are as follows -</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"first-they-get-a-set-of-n-distinct-integers-and-then-they-take-turns-to-make-the-following-moves-during-each-move-either-alice-or-bob-the-player-whose-turn-is-the-current-can-choose-two-distinct-integers-x-and-y-from-the-set-such-that-the-set-doesnt-contain-their-absolute-difference-x-y-then-this-player-adds-integer-x-y-to-the-set-so-the-size-of-the-set-increases-by-one\">First, they get a set of \u2018N\u2019 distinct integers. And then they take turns to make the following moves. During each move, either Alice or Bob (the player whose turn is the current) can choose two distinct integers \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 from the set, such that the set doesn&#39;t contain their absolute difference |X -\u2009Y|. Then this player adds integer |X\u2009-\u2009Y| to the set (so, the size of the set increases by one).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"if-the-current-player-has-no-valid-move-he-or-she-loses-the-game-the-question-is-who-will-finally-win-the-game-if-both-players-play-optimally-remember-that-alice-always-moves-first\">If the current player has no valid move, he (or she) loses the game. The question is who will finally win the game if both players play optimally. Remember that Alice always moves first.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer T representing the number of test cases.

Alice moves first, and the only move she can do is to choose 2 and 3, then to add 1 to the set. The new set is { 1, 2, 3 }. Next Bob moves, there is no valid move anymore, so the winner is Alice.\n\nFor the second test case, we have, initial set as { 3, 5}. Alice moves first, and the only move she can do is to choose 5 and 3, then to add 2 to the set. So, the new set is { 2, 3, 5 }. Next Bob moves, he cannot choose 2 and 5 as | 2 - 5 | = 3 is already in the set. He chooses 2 and 3 and adds 1 to the set. The new set is { 1, 2, 3, 5 }. Now, Alice can choose 1 and 5 and add 4 to the set. The new set is { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }. Next Bob moves, there is no valid move anymore, so the winner is Alice.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n2\n2 3\n2\n5 3\n3\n5 6 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Alice\nAlice\nBob\n</code></pre>\n",
