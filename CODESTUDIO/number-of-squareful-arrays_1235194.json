However, the problem states to return the number of squareful *permutations*, not whether the given array itself is squareful. Thus, since all elements are the same there is only 1 possible unique permutation.  Every adjacent pair sums to 2 (not a perfect square). Therefore there is **1** permutation.  The original sample output of 0 is incorrect in this case, assuming the logic of counting unique squareful permutations, the only possible permutation gives adjacent pairs that do not sum to a perfect square"
