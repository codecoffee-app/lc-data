As the numbers can be too large, you need to return both the numbers mod 10 ^ 9 + 7.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-subsequence-is-a-sequence-that-can-be-derived-from-the-given-sequence-by-deleting-zero-or-more-elements-without-changing-the-order-of-the-remaining-elements-for-example-consider-the-array-1-2-3-there-are-7-possible-subsequences-for-this-they-are-1-2-3-1-2-1-3-2-3-1-2-3\">A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, consider the array {1, 2, 3}, there are 7 possible subsequences for this. They are {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"even-sum-subsequence-means-the-subsequence-whose-total-sum-sum-of-all-the-elements-in-the-subsequence-is-divisible-by-2-and-for-odd-sum-subsequence-the-total-sum-leaves-a-remainder-of-1-when-divided-by-2\">Even sum subsequence means the subsequence whose total sum( sum of all the elements in the subsequence) is divisible by 2. And for odd sum subsequence, the total sum leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1) In general, for an array of size &#39;N&#39;, there are (2 ^ &#39;N&#39; - 1) non-empty subsequences possible.
