First-line contains \u20181\u2019. From the second line, we have to place a number one less than the row number at two ends of the row and place zeros in between. So we place \u20181\u2019 at two ends, and since the second line contains only two numbers, so there will be no \u20180\u2019.In the third line, we have to place  \u20182\u2019, because row number is 3 and one number less than that is \u20182\u2019, at two ends. This line will have 3 digits, so we have to place one \u20180\u2019 between the 2 \u20182\u2019.\nIn the second test case, we are required to create a pattern consisting of 1 line.
