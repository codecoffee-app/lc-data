Tables for the delegates and security personnel have been arranged. A total of \u2018N\u2019 rows of tables has been set up. The first row has one table, the second row has two, and so on. To ensure maximum security, the tables on either end of each row have been assigned for security personnel each. If there is only one table in a row, it will be assigned to a security personnel. The tables assigned for security personnel will host exactly one security personnel each. All the other tables will host two guests each.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-integer-n-which-denotes-the-number-of-rows-you-are-supposed-to-print-the-table-pattern-indicating-the-number-of-guests-or-security-personnel-at-each-table-in-other-words-print-the-number-of-people-in-each-table\">You are given an integer \u2018N\u2019, which denotes the number of rows., You are supposed to print the table pattern indicating the number of guests or security personnel at each table.

As mentioned in the plan, the end tables should have security personnel, so both tables will have security personnel. The third row hosts security personnel on table 1 and table 3.
