First, each player chooses an integer in the range from 1 to \u2018N\u2019. Let&#39;s assume that Ninja Misha chose the number \u2018numMisha\u2019, and Ninja Andrew chose the number \u2018numAndrew\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"then-by-using-a-random-generator-they-choose-a-random-integer-c-in-the-range-between-1-and-n-any-integer-from-1-to-n-is-chosen-with-the-same-probability-after-which-the-winner-is-the-player-whose-number-was-closer-to-c-the-boys-agreed-that-if-nummisha-and-numandrew-are-located-on-the-same-distance-from-c-misha-wins\">Then, by using a random generator they choose a random integer \u2018C\u2019 in the range between 1 and \u2018N\u2019 (any integer from 1 to \u2018N\u2019 is chosen with the same probability), after which the winner is the player whose number was closer to \u2018C\u2019. The boys agreed that if \u2018numMisha\u2019 and \u2018numAndrew\u2019 are located on the same distance from \u2018C\u2019, Misha wins.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"andrew-wants-to-win-very-much-so-he-asks-you-to-help-him-you-know-the-number-selected-by-ninja-misha-and-the-number-n-you-need-to-determine-which-value-ninja-andrew-must-choose-so-that-the-probability-of-his-victory-is-the-highest-possible\">Andrew wants to win very much, so he asks you to help him.
