Therefore his fellow Ninja Nikhil gave him a riddle to check if Ankush is really the Ultimate Ninja. Nikhil gave Ankush a range and a number \u2018K\u2019, and asked how many numbers exist in the range such that the product of the digits of the number is equal to \u2018K\u2019. Help Ninja Ankush to prove to Ninja Nikhil that he, in fact, is the Ultimate Ninja.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"more-formally-given-three-positive-integers-l-r-and-k-the-task-is-to-count-the-numbers-in-the-range-l-and-r-inclusive-whose-product-of-digits-is-equal-to-k\">More Formally, Given three positive integers \u2018L\u2019, \u2018R\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019, the task is to count the numbers in the range \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 inclusive, whose product of digits is equal to \u2018K\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Given:\n\u2018L\u2019 = 1, \u2018R\u2019 = 23, \u2018K\u2019 = 6.\n\nThe answer will be 3 since there are three numbers between 1 and 23 whose product of digits is 6, and those are 6, 16, and 23.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nNext, \u2018T\u2019 lines consist of three space-separated integers, \u2018L\u2019, \u2018R\u2019, \u2018K\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the count of numbers between \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 whose product of digits is \u2018K\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of.
