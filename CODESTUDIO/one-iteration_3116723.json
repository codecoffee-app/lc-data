This time, Alice gave Bob an array \u2018A\u2019 of \u2018N\u2019 distinct integers and asked him to find the maximum sum Bob can make by taking two elements from this array. To make this challenging, Alice asked Bob to find the answer by traversing the array only once.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"as-always-bob-asked-you-to-help-him-do-the-task-by-traversing-the-array-only-once\">As always, Bob asked you to help him do the task by traversing the array only once.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the size of the array.\n\nThe following line contains an array \u2018A\u2019 of \u2018N\u2019 spaced distinct integers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer in a new line denoting the maximum sum Bob can make by taking two integers from the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output.
