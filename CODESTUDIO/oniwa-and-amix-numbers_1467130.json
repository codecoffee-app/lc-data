To make the OR equal to 12 (1100 in binary), we can flip the two rightmost bits of the OR result from '1' to '0'. The OR of A and B is 15 (1111). The target value is 12 (1100). We flip two bits in A OR B to make it equal to C. Therefore three flips are required as 1111 & 6 = 15 so flipping the number 15 from 1111 to 1100 would mean 3 flips will be needed."
