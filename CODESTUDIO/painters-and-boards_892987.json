Any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board. \n   For eg, A configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 and not 2 is invalid.\n2. A board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to run.
