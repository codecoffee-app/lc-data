If HOUSES[i] = 0, it means that the house is not coloured, so Ninja has to colour it. Otherwise, the already painted houses should not be painted again. Your task is to find the minimum cost for colouring these houses so that exactly \u2018M\u2019 neighbourhood groups can be formed if it is impossible to paint them in this manner, print -1.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the given \u2018HOUSES\u2019 array is [0,2,1,2,0] and \u2018COST\u2019 array is [ [1,7],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],  [5,1] ] and \u2018M\u2019 = 3. \n The minimum cost will be 7+1 =8.
