Ninja wants to repair it as soon as possible. Help ninja to find the nearest service station. You are given a character matrix, \u2018GRID\u2019 of size \u2018N x M\u2019. The \u2018grid\u2019 contains the following characters:<ul><li>\u2018N\u2019 represents the ninja\u2019s location. There is exactly one cell with the character \u2018N\u2019 in it.</li><li>\u2018S\u2019 represents a service station. The \u2018GRID\u2019 can have multiple \u2018S\u2019 cells (&gt;= 0).</li><li>\u2018O\u2019 is a free space, and the ninja can travel through these cells</li><li>\u2018X\u2019 is an obstacle, and the ninja cannot travel through these cells.</li></ul></h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-ninja-can-only-travel-to-adjacent-free-cells-from-his-current-location-i-e-in-the-north-south-east-or-west-direction-your-task-is-to-find-the-length-of-the-shortest-path-through-which-the-ninja-can-get-to-a-service-station-if-there-is-no-such-path-available-return-1\">The Ninja can only travel to adjacent free cells from his current location, i.e., in the North, South, East, or West direction.

If there is no such path available, return -1.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018N\u2019 = 4, \u2018M\u2019 = 6\nGiven \u2018GRID\u2019:\n(Empty cells represent the character \u2018O\u2019)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/example-path-to-the-nearest-station-8614.png\" alt=\"example\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>The Ninja can reach the nearest service station by moving two cells south and then three cells east.
