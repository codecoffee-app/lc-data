Your task is to find out whether K is a perfect number or not.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Perfect numbers are those numbers that are equal to the sum of all its proper divisors. \n\nProper divisors are all the divisors of a number excluding the number itself. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example  :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For K = 6, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and its sum is 6 so 6 is a perfect number. For K = 8, the proper divisors of 8 are 1, 2,4 and its sum is 7 so 8 is not a perfect number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains a single positive integer K, as described in the problem statement.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return true if K is a perfect number or else return false.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraint\">Constraint :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n2 &lt;= K &lt;= 10^8\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"follow-up\">Follow Up :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Can you do this in O(sqrt(N)) time and constant space?\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n2\n6\n8\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>False\nTrue\nFalse\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the only proper divisor of 2 is 1 so 2 is not a perfect number.\n\nThe test cases 2 and 3 are already explained above.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n10\n28\n12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>False\nTrue\nFalse\n</code></pre>\n",
