You want to choose the team with the highest total skill. The total skill is the sum of skills of all players in the team. However, in a team, no two players must exist such that the younger player has greater skill than the older player. In a team, two people of the same age can have different skill levels. Return the highest total skill of the team which is possible.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let\u2019s say the age of players is [1,2,6,4] and the skill of players is [1,2,3,4]. We cannot take all players in the team as 3rd player is older than 4th player but 4th player has strictly greater skill than 3rd player. Therefore we can take anyone among them. Therefore the highest total skill of team which is possible is 7.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 representing the number of players.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 single space-separated integers representing the age of players.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 single space-separated integers representing the skill of players.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer denoting the highest total skill of the team which is possible.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
