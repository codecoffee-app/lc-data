She saw that the phone had a numeric keypad and each number was mapped to some alphabets as shown in the figure below. She has a list of valid words. She wants to create an algorithm that would take a given sequence of numbers as input and return a list of matching words that are also present in her list of valid words.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000284_1615383849_Phone Code.png\"></img></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code> You can convert the list of valid words into any data structure you desire.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the sequence of number = 2633, and the list of valid words = [ride, used, code, tree, boed], \nThen you would print \u201ccode\u201d and \u201cboed\u201d as they can be formed by using the digit sequence and they are also present in the list of valid words.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.
