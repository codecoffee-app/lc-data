But they found that the slices of pizza are not uniform. Ninja is very hungry so he wants to take the bigger slices of pizza. So all friends decided to follow the rule while eating pizza:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 . Ninja will pick a slice of pizza.\n2 . One of his friends will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction.\n3 . the Second friend will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction of Ninja\u2019s pick.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-array-arr-having-the-weights-of-n-slices-representing-a-circular-array-in-the-clockwise-direction-n-is-a-multiple-of-3-ninja-wants-to-collect-the-slices-such-that-their-sum-is-maximum-can-you-help-ninja-to-solve-this-problem-and-tell-him-the-maximum-sum-he-can-achieve\">You are given an array \u2018ARR\u2019 having the weights of \u2018N\u2019 slices representing a circular array in the clockwise direction.N is a multiple of 3. Ninja wants to collect the slices such that their sum is maximum. Can you help Ninja to solve this problem and tell him the maximum sum he can achieve?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the ARR is [4,3,11,12,2,4] , so the optimal answer will be as follows:\nNinja will pick the slice having weight 12, so his friends will pick the slices having weights 11 and 2. After that Ninja will pick the slice with weight 4 and his friends will pick 4 and 3.\nNinja\u2019s sum will be 16 which is the maximum.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, \u2018N\u2019, denoting the number of elements in array \u2018ARR\u2019.\n\nThe following line contains \u2018N\u2019 values corresponding to elements of \u2018ARR\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the maximum sum of the weight of slices.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of.

After that Ninja will pick the slice with weight 4 and his friends will pick 4 and 3.\nNinja\u2019s sum will be 16 which is the maximum.\nHence, the answer is 16.\n\nFor the second test case:\n\nNinja will pick the slice having weight 6, so his friends will pick the slices having weights 5 and 1. After that Ninja will pick the slice with weight 4 and his friends will pick 3 and 2.\nNinja\u2019s sum will be 10 which is the maximum.\nHence,the answer is 10.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n9\n6 5 8 4 9 2 3 1 9 \n6\n6 9 7 2 10 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>26\n19\n</code></pre>\n",
