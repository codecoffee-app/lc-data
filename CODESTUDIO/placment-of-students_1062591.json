There are M students and N companies who are offering jobs. Each student is interested in a particular number of companies for a job. Each job opening can only accept one student and a student can only have 1 job. As a placement coordinator, you want to place a maximum number of students.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-maximum-number-of-students-that-can-be-placed-in-one-of-their-desired-jobs\">Your task is to find the maximum number of students that can be placed in one of their desired jobs</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-data-about-the-set-of-favourable-jobs-are-given-in-the-form-of-an-m-n-binary-matrix-named-mat-i-e-for-m-students-we-have-m-rows-each-having-n-integers-now-for-example-if-the-first-candidate-is-interested-in-job1-the-value-of-mat-i-j-will-be-1-otherwise-it-will-be-0\">The data about the set of favourable jobs are given in the form of an M * N binary matrix named \u2018mat\u2019, i.e for M students we have M rows each having N integers. Now for example if the first candidate is interested in job1 the value of mat[i][j] will be 1 otherwise it will be 0.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>It is possible that a single candidate is interested in multiple jobs but he can take up only one of the job out of his favourable jobs, also there is no priority in jobs, i.e all favourable jobs are equally favourable to the candidate\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.
