He met two kids on his way, Gon and Killua. They gave him four numbers A, B, C, and M where M is a Prime Number and told him that if he can calculate A ^ (B ^ C) Mod M, he will gain a lot of powers. Hisoka is weak in coding. Can you help hisoka solve this problem of powers.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, M = 5\n\nComputing B ^ C gives 2 ^ 3 = 8, Now A ^ (B ^ C) = 2 ^ 8 = 256.  256 Mod 5 is 1. Hence the final answer is 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to be run. Then each test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, and M.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer \u2018ans\u2019.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function and return the answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= A, B, C &lt;= 10^9\n1 &lt; M &lt;= 10^9 + 7\n\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 2 3 11\n5 2 2 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation For Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, the value of 2 ^ 3 is 8 and hence the value of 3 ^ 8 is 6561. 6561 mod 11 is 5. So the final Answer is 5.\n\nFor the second test case, the value of 2 ^ 2 is 4 and hence the value of 5 ^ 4 is 625. 625 mod 7 is 2. So the final Answer is 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 9 4 19\n55 69 21 998244353 \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>18\n441977229\n</code></pre>\n",
