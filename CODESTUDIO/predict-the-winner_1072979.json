There is a number written on the back of the shirts of every person. One person among them has a ball in his hands and the number written on his shirt&#39;s back is 1. The number written on the shirt of every other person is 1 more than the number written on the shirt of the person standing to the left of him. We have also been provided with an integer &#39;K&#39; denoting the jump parameter. They start playing a game. The game proceeds as follows:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. If there is only one person remaining in the game then the game stops immediately and the person is declared the winner.\n2. The player who currently has the ball in its hand passes the ball to the person standing to his right. \n3. Step 2 happens exactly &#39;K&#39;-1 times.\n4. The game pauses here and the person who has the ball in his hand currently has to pass the ball to the person standing on his right and has to leave the game.\n5.
