Two numbers are considered adjacent to each other if the absolute difference between them is 1.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4 is a prime adjacent because it is adjacent to the numbers 3 and 5, which are prime numbers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-out-if-the-number-given-to-you-is-prime-adjacent-or-not\">Your task is to find out if the number given to you is prime adjacent or not.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case or query contains an integer N.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u201cYes\u201d if N is prime adjacent, otherwise print \u201cNo\u201d (without inverted commas), in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^6\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 \n2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Yes\nNo\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For test case 1:\n4 is a prime adjacent because its adjacent numbers, 3 and 5 are prime numbers.\n\nFor test case 2:\nIn case of 2, the adjacent numbers are 1 and 3, out of which 1 is not prime but 3 is     \nprime. \n\nBy definition, a number is a prime adjacent only if both of its adjacent numbers are prime numbers. So, 2 is not a prime adjacent.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n3 \n18\n25\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>No\nYes\nNo\n</code></pre>\n",
