You as an animal lover wanted to free all the cats but the box can be only opened with a password which is an integer. After researching Schrodinger you came to know that he loves prime numbers and palindrome numbers and his favourite number \u2018N\u2019. Now you know that the password is the smallest number that is greater than \u2018N\u2019 which is both prime and palindrome.
