Your task is to determine the total number of different permutations of the numbers from 1 to \u2018N\u2019, such that in every such permutation, all prime numbers within the range, 1 to \u2018N\u2019 are present at prime indices(1-indexed), and composite numbers at composite indices.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The permutation [1,4,3,2] is not a valid permutation because 2 is a prime number and thus it should be placed at a prime index but in this permutation, it is placed at index 4(1-indexed). Also, at index 2, a prime number should have been placed as 2 is a prime number but here, 4 is placed which is not a prime number. So, this is an invalid permutation.\n\n2. The permutation [1,3,2,4] is a valid permutation because 2 and 3 are prime numbers, so index 2 and index 3 are prime indices. In this permutation, prime numbers are placed at prime indices only and composite numbers are placed at composite indices so this is a valid permutation.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, \u2018N\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return a single integer, denoting the total number of required permutations. Since, the answer may be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of.

These two permutations are:\n1, 2, 3\n1, 3, 2\n\nThere are only two prime numbers in the range of 1 to 3. These two numbers are 2 and 3. So the prime indices will be 2 and 3(1-indexed). We can observe in all the above-mentioned permutations, that at index 2 and 3, there are only prime numbers. There does not exist any other permutation, where all this condition is satisfied. Hence, we print 2 as our answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-2\">Explanation for sample input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>There are only four different permutations of the numbers from 1 to 4, in which the prime numbers are present at prime indices.
