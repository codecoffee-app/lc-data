Where \u2018DAY_HOURS\u2019 is the number of hours in a day and a day can be divided into \u2018PARTS\u2019 equal parts. Your task is to find total instances of equivalent prime groups. Prime group refers to the group of elements (hours) which are prime and measure the same equivalent time since the start of the day.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-if-we-consider-day_hours-to-be-24-and-parts-to-be-2-then-the-day-of-total-24-hours-is-divided-into-2-parts-1-12-and-13-24-5-hours-in-the-first-part-of-the-day-is-equivalent-to-17-which-is-5-hours-into-the-second-part-of-the-day-and-since-5-and-17-both-are-prime-they-can-be-considered-as-a-prime-group\">For example, if we consider \u2018DAY_HOURS\u2019 to be 24 and \u2018PARTS\u2019 to be 2, then the day of total 24 hours is divided into 2 parts ( 1 - 12 ) and ( 13 - 24 ). 5 hours in the first part of the day is equivalent to 17, which is 5 hours into the second part of the day.

A prime group consists of hours that are prime numbers and represent the same relative time within each part of the day.\n\nFor example, if `DAY_HOURS` is 24 and `PARTS` is 2, the day is divided into (1-12) and (13-24). The 5th hour in the first part corresponds to the 17th hour in the second part (5 hours into the second segment). Since both 5 and 17 are prime, they form a prime group.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1.  The day starts at hour 1 and ends at hour `DAY_HOURS`.\n2.  Each hour in a prime group must belong to a different segment of the day.\n3.  If no prime groups are found, return 0.\n4.  `DAY_HOURS` is always divisible by `PARTS`.",
