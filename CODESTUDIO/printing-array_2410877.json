For example, for the given array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], a few valid subsequences are [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the subsequences = [[1,3,9], [3,9,5]], for the given subsequences the output array could be [1, 3, 9, 5] as: \n1 is before 3 and 9\n5 is after 3 and 9\n3 is before 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. The description of  \u2018T\u2019 test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of subsequences.\n\nThe next \u2018N\u2019 lines contain space-separated integers of the given subsequence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print &quot;CORRECT&quot; if the array formed with the subsequences is correct.
