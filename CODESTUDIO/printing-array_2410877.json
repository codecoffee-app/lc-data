For example, for the given array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], a few valid subsequences are [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider the subsequences = [[1,3,9], [3,9,5]], for the given subsequences the output array could be [1, 3, 9, 5] as: \n1 is before 3 and 9\n5 is after 3 and 9\n3 is before 9\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.
