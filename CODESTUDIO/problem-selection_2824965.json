You had prepared for the test, but this time your teacher has prepared something special for you, he gave you \u2018N\u2019 problems and an array \u2018A\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019, where each problem gives you A[i] marks if you answer it. The teacher has given some constraints on how you can answer the question. Every time you answer a question, he will block \u2018K\u2019 questions of your choice that has not been answered or blocked yet. If you have fewer than \u2018K\u2019 questions, he will block all the questions. Once a question is blocked, you can not answer it. Since you prepared last night, you know the answers to all the problems. Now you are wondering what\u2019s the minimum and maximum marks you can achieve in the test.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-you-cannot-leave-the-test-until-all-the-questions-are-either-answered-or-blocked-you-will-never-answer-a-question-incorrectly\">Note: You cannot leave the test until all the questions are either answered or blocked.
