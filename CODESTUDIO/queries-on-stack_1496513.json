We increment the bottom 2 elements by 1.\nStack after 4th query, i.e PUSH 1, be [4, 3, 1] as the size of the stack cannot exceed 3.\nStack after 5th query, i.e POP, be [4, 3] and we should return 1 for this query.\nStack after 6th query, i.e INC 3 3, be [7, 6] as stack size is less than 3, so we every element.\nStack after the 7th query, i.e POP, be [7] and we should return 6 for this query.\nStack after 8th query, i.e POP, be [] and we should return 7 for this query.\nStack after the 9th query, i.e POP, be [] and we should return -1 for this query.\n\nThus we should return an array/list [1, 6, 7, -1].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to be run.
