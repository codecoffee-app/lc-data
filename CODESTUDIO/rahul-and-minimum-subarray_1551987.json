He is currently learning about arrays/lists. One day his teacher asked him to solve a very difficult problem. The problem was to find the length of the smallest subarray(subarray is a contiguous part of an array/list) in a given array/list \u2018ARR\u2019 of size \u2018N\u2019 with its sum greater than a given value.
