The cost of converting this black money into white money is abs(1 - 0) * 4 (i.e TotalCost = 4).

The cost of converting 1 unit of black money into white money is abs(3 - 0) * 1. (i.e TotalCost = 7). Now \u2018HOUSES\u2019 = [0, 0, 1, -2, 1].\n\nThen, we pick \u2018HOUSES[2]\u2019 and the cost of converting 1unit of black money into white money is abs(3 - 2) * 1 (i.e TotalCost = 8).
