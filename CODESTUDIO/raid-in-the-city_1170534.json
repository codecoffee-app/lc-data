Now people having black money want to convert it into white money as soon as possible. The only possible way to do this conversion is to take the black money to the houses with white money.

The cost of converting this black money into white money is abs(1 - 0) * 4 (i.e TotalCost = 4).

The cost of converting 1 unit of black money into white money is abs(3 - 0) * 1. (i.e TotalCost = 7). Now \u2018HOUSES\u2019 = [0, 0, 1, -2, 1].\n\nThen, we pick \u2018HOUSES[2]\u2019 and the cost of converting 1unit of black money into white money is abs(3 - 2) * 1 (i.e TotalCost = 8).

Now \u2018HOUSES\u2019 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and there exists no more black money\n\n\nFor sample test case 2: \n\nIn this sample test case\nFirst, we pick \u2018HOUSES[2]\u2019 (0-based indexing) and transfer all the black money to  \u2018HOUSES[0]\u2019. The cost of converting this black money into white money is abs(2 - 0) * 1 (i.e TotalCost = 2).
