Ninja has to implement a method \u2018READ\u2019, which reads \u2019N\u2019 characters from the \u2018FILE\u2019 using the \u2018READ4\u2019 method.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"how-read4-and-read-method-s-work\">How \u2018READ4\u2019 and \u2018READ\u2019 method\u2019s work:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018READ4(char \u2018BUFFER[]\u2019)\u2019\n\n 1) It reads 4 characters at a time from the \u2018FILE\u2019.\n 2) The return value of the \u2018READ4\u2019 method is the actual number of characters read.\n 3) For example, if in a \u2018FILE\u2019 only three characters are remaining, then it returns 3.\n\n\u2018READ(char \u2018BUFFER[]\u2019, int \u2018N\u2019)\u2019\n\n 1) \u2018N\u2019 represents the number of characters to be read from \u2018FILE\u2019.\n 2) In this method, you have to store your result in \u2018BUFFER\u2019.\n 3) In this method, you have to return the number of characters read from \u2018FILE\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-the-method-read-may-be-called-multiple-times\">Note: The method \u2018READ\u2019 may be called multiple times.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>\u2018FILE\u2019 = \u201cabcdef\u201d\n\nInitially file pointer \u2018FP\u2019 points to \u2018a\u2019.\n\u2018READ4(BUFFER) returns 4 and \u2018BUFFER\u2019 contains \u201cabcd\u201d, Now the \u2018FP\u2019 points to \u2018e\u2019.\n\u2018READ4(BUFFER) returns 2 and \u2018BUFFER\u2019 contains \u201cef\u201d, Now the \u2018FP\u2019 points to the end of the \u2018FILE\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.

First, we have to read 6 characters from the file.\n\nFirst, we call the \u2018READ4(\u2018BUFFER\u2019)\u2019 method, it returns 4 and the \u2018BUFFER\u2019 contains \u201cabcd\u201d.\nThen we again call the \u2018READ4(\u2018BUFFER\u2019)\u2019 method, it returns 4 and now the \u2018BUFFER\u2019 contains \u201cefgh\u201d. \nThen, we print the first 6 characters of the \u2018FILE\u2019 i.e. \u201cabcedef\u201d.\n\nSecond, we have to read 4 characters from the file.\nBut there are only two characters are remaining so we print only these two characters i.e. \u201cgh\u201d.\n\nFor sample test case 2: \n\nIn this test case, \u2018FILE\u2019 is \u201cffggdd\u201d and initially the file pointer \u2018FP\u2019 \npoints to \u201cf\u201d (0-index). First, we have to read 3 characters from the file.\n\nFirst, we call the \u2018READ4(\u2018BUFFER\u2019)\u2019 method, it returns 4 and the \u2018BUFFER\u2019 contains \u201cffgg\u201d.\nThen, we print the first 3 characters of the \u2018FILE\u2019 i.e. \u201cffg\u201d.\n\nSecond, we have to read 4 characters from the file.\nNow in \u2018BUFFER\u2019, we have only one character remaining. So we again call the \u2018READ4(\u2018BUFFER\u2019)\u2019 method, it returns 2 and now the \u2018BUFFER\u2019 contains \u201cdd\u201d.\nAs we know we have to print the next characters of the \u2018FILE\u2019 but only 3 characters are remaining in the \u2018FILE\u2019 so we print these 3 characters only i.e. \u201cgdd\u201d.\n\nThird, we have to read 5 characters from the file.\nAs we know we read all the characters of the \u2018FILE\u2019. \nNow the file pointer \u2018FP\u2019 points to the end of the file so we print an empty string.\n\nFourth, we have to read 2 characters from the file.\nAs we know we read all the characters of the \u2018FILE\u2019. \nNow the file pointer \u2018FP\u2019 points to the end of the file so we print an empty string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\nabcd\n1\n2\npsadas\n2 \n3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2 ab\n3 psa\n3 das\n</code></pre>\n",
