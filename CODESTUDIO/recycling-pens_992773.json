You can recycle one pen and get 2 rupees as a reward so you will have a total of 12 rupees. Now you can buy 4 refills and combine it with 4 pens to make it usable. So your answer is 4.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains a single integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases.
