Each ball has a number associated with it, the numbers associated with the balls are given in the array &#39;ARR&#39;. But your cupboard has slots such that only N/2 balls can be kept. So, you decided to remove the balls following an operation.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-one-operation-you-can-select-a-ball-numbered-x-and-remove-all-the-balls-which-are-numbered-x\">In one operation, you can select a ball numbered \u2018x\u2019 and remove all the balls which are numbered \u2018x\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-supposed-to-minimize-the-number-of-operations-such-that-at-least-half-of-the-balls-are-removed-from-n-balls\">You are supposed to minimize the number of operations such that at least half of the balls are removed from \u2018N\u2019 balls.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Numbers on the balls may not be unique.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.

The number of remaining balls will be 2. So, the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, 10 balls are given numbered [2, 1, 4, 2, 2 ,2, 3, 3, 3, 3].\nIn order to remove at least 5 balls, the most efficient approach is to remove all the balls numbered \u20182\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 as there are 4 balls numbered \u20182\u2019 and 4 balls numbered \u20183\u2019.The number of remaining balls will be 2.
