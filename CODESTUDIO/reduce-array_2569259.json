Similarly, to insert the sum in the position of element \u2018B\u2019, the condition 2 * \u2018B\u2019 &gt;= A should be satisfied.\n\n3- We will insert the sum at one position, and the value at the other position should be changed to -1.\n\n4- The resultant array should contain only 1 positive element.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-count-of-distinct-combinations-possible-for-the-array\">Your task is to find the count of distinct combinations possible for the array.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>A combination is different if they lead to a different position of the element that remains positive at the end of all successful operations for that combination.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let \u2018ARR\u2019 be: {2, 1}\nCombination 1: \nPick 2 and 1 and insert their sum at the position of 2: [3, -1]\n\nCombination 2:\nPick 2 and 1 and insert their sum at the position of 1: [-1, 3]\n\nSo total combinations are 2.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019, representing the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers, representing the array \u2018ARR\u2019 elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer representing the count of distinct combinations possible for the array.\n\nPrint output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

In each operation, two positive integers, 'A' and 'B', are chosen, their sum ('A' + 'B') is calculated, and the sum replaces either 'A' or 'B'.  The other element is then replaced with -1. The sum can only replace 'A' if 2 * 'A' >= 'B', or replace 'B' if 2 * 'B' >= 'A'. Determine the number of distinct final positions where the last positive element can reside after performing these operations.",
