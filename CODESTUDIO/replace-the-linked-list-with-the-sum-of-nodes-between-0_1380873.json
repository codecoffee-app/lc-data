Each line is guaranteed to have -1 at the end to signify the end of the linked list. Also, None of the elements of the linked list is -1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print space-separated integers denoting the nodes of the output linked list, in a separate line.\n\nEach new line denotes a separated linked list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don&#39;t need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

So the modified, linked list will be 14 -&gt; 7.\n\nTest Case 2: The only series formed in the linked list 1,2,3 have sum = 6. Therefore modified linked list will be 6.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5 3 8 2 -1\n0 6 0 4 0 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5 3 8 2\n6 4\n</code></pre>\n",
