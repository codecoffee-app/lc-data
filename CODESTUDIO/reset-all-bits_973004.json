Your task is to make all the bits to the right of the most significant set bit as zero (0).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If the input integer is 45 i.e \u2018101101\u2019. Then after resetting the bits, it will be \u2018100000\u2019. Here The MSB set bit is 3rd from left and hence only the 3rd bit from the left will be set and the rest all the bits will be zero (0). \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains an Integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the 32-bit integer whose bits need to be altered. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the integer after making all the bits to the right of the most significant set bit as zero (0).\n\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"follow-up\">Follow Up:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Can you solve this using O(1) time complexity.    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10^2\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5\n\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n9\n6\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>8\n4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation For Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the given integer is 9 (1001). Thus by changing every bit to zero to the right of MSB, it becomes 8 (1000).\n\nIn the second test case, the given integer is 6 (110). Thus by changing every bit to zero to the right of MSB, it becomes 4 (100).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n15\n25\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>8\n16\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-2\">Explanation For Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, the given integer is 15 (11111). Thus by changing every bit to zero to the right of MSB, it becomes 8 (1000).\n\nIn the second test case, the given integer is 25 (11001).
