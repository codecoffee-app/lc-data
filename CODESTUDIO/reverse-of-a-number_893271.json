So, he decides to find the reverse of a given number. But he cannot do it on his own and needs your help.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If a number has trailing zeros, then its reverse will not include them. For e.g., the reverse of 10400 will be 401 instead of 00401.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the given number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each case, you need to print the reverse of the given number.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to input or print anything, it has already been taken care of.

Therefore our solution is 401\n\nTest case 2:   \nFor the second test case of sample output 1, as the number is \u201812345\u2019, the reverse will be \u201854321\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1000\n7654321\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1\n1234567\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-2\">Explanation of Sample Input 2:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Test case 1:\nFor the first test case of sample output 2, as the input number is \u20181000\u2019, we get the reverse as \u20181\u2019.\n\nTest case 2:   \nFor the second test case of sample output 2, as the input number is \u20187654321\u2019, we get the reverse as \u20181234567\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n",
