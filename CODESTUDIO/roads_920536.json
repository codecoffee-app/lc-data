You are in city \u2018S\u2019 with a car having \u2018P\u2019 amount of petrol in it. Roads are bidirectional and consume your petrol. Each road has a description \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018Z\u2019, which means city \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 have a road between them which consumes \u2018Z\u2019 amount of petrol. You want to visit the city \u2018D\u2019. Your task is to check if it&#39;s possible to visit \u2018D\u2019 from \u2018S\u2019 using \u2018P\u2019 amount of petrol.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the given graph, if we want to reach from node 1 to node 4 with \u2018P\u2019 = 10, then our answer is \u2018Yes\u2019 because there exists path 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4, which takes 7 amount of petrol, which is less than the given value of \u2018P\u2019 so it is possible and hence, the answer is \u2018Yes\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/asset_0000000000000470_1625905718_graph.png\" alt=\"undirected\"></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains a single integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers, \u2018V\u2019, \u2018E\u2019, and \u2019P\u2019, denoting the number of vertices, the number of edges in the graph, and the amount of petrol in the car.\n\nThe next \u2018E\u2019 lines of each test case contain three space-separated integers, \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018Z\u2019, denoting the vertices which are connected with a bidirectional edge, and the weight of the edge.\n\nThe last line of each test case has two space-separated integers, \u2018S\u2019 and \u2019D\u2019, representing the source and destination vertices.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u201cYes\u201d if there exists a path from vertex &#39;S\u2019 to &#39;D\u2019 which consumes less than or equal to the given amount of petrol \u2018P\u2019.
