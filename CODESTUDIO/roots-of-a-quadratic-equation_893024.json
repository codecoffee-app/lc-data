Your task is to find the real roots of the quadratic equation or report if no real roots exist (return a pair of -1).</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let\u2019s consider the equation X^2 + 2X + 1 = 0 . We can see that the quadratic equation has no real roots. So we return a pair of -1 i.e. [-1, -1].\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"we-can-consider-the-equation-x-2-5x-6-0-as-depicted-from-the-equation-the-value-of-a-would-be-1-b-would-be-5-and-c-would-be-6-we-can-see-that-this-equation-has-two-distinct-roots-2-and-3-hence-we-return-an-array-sequence-containing-2-and-3\">We can consider the equation X^2 - 5X - 6 = 0. As depicted from the equation the value of &#39;A&#39; would be 1, &#39;B&#39; would be -5 and &#39;C&#39; would be -6. We can see that this equation has two distinct roots -2 and -3. Hence we return an array/sequence containing -2  and-3.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. If the equation has repeated roots, return the roots twice.\n2. If there are imaginary roots, return -1 twice.\n3. If the root is not an integer, return the greatest integer value less \nthan the root.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and the only line of each test case consists of three single space-separated integers &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, and &#39;C&#39; which denotes the integer coefficients in the polynomial: AX^2 + BX + C = 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print in a single line two single space-separated integers, denoting the roots of the quadratic equation. \n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

Solving the equation we get (X-2)(X-3)=0 which gives us the factors of the given equation, hence the roots are X=2 and X=3. Therefore we return 2 and 3.\n\nFor the second test case, we can see that the quadratic equation is X^2-2X-2=0. Solving we get (X-1+\u221a3)(X+1-\u221a3)=0 which gives us the factors of the given equation, hence the roots are X= (1-\u221a3)\u2248 -0.732051 and X=(1+\u221a3)\u22482.732051. Since the roots are not integers, we return the greatest integer less than the roots i.e 0 and 2 respectively.\n\nFor the third test case, we can see that the quadratic equation is X^2+1=0. Trying to solve it we get X^2=-1. We know that it is impossible to have the square of a real number equal to a negative number, so this quadratic equation has imaginary roots. Hence we return -1 twice.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 -6 -18\n1 -7 12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>-2 3\n3 4\n</code></pre>\n",
