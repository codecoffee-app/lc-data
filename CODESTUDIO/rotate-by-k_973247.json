The Bit Rotation is an operation similar to shift except that the bits that fall off at one end are put back to the other end.</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1- If \u2018K\u2019 is negative, you have to perform left rotation. The bits that fall off at the left end are put back at the right end.\n\n2- If \u2018K\u2019 is positive, you have to perform the right rotation. The bits that fall off at the right end are put back at the left end.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Consider If N = 13 and K = 2, then\nBits representation of N is 1101.\nAs K is greater than 0, we have to perform the right rotation\nAfter the first rotation, bits representation will be 1110\nAfter the second rotation, bits representation will be 0111\nThe integer value corresponding to \u20180111\u2019 is 7.
