Ninja starts walking from some node (say \u2018START\u2019) in the graph along a directed edge of the graph. If Ninja reaches an end node (say \u2018END\u2019) (a node that has no outgoing directed edges), Ninja stops walking.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"now-a-starting-node-start-is-a-safe-node-only-if-ninja-must-eventually-walk-to-an-end-node-end-more-specifically-there-must-be-a-natural-number-k-so-that-ninja-must-have-stopped-at-an-end-node-in-less-than-k-steps-for-any-choice-of-where-to-walk\">Now a starting node \u2018START\u2019 is a safe node only if Ninja must eventually walk to an end node \u2018END\u2019. More specifically, there must be a natural number \u2018K\u2019, so that Ninja must have stopped at an end node in less than \u2018K\u2019 steps for any choice of where to walk.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example-for-the-graph-as-shown-in-the-picture-below-2-4-are-the-only-safe-nodes\">For Example: For the graph, as shown in the picture below, [2, 4] are the only safe nodes.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/example-8715.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-wants-to-know-all-the-safe-nodes-in-the-graph-in-sorted-order-can-you-help-ninja-to-find-out-all-the-safe-nodes\">Ninja wants to know all the safe nodes in the graph in sorted order.
