Tony and Thanos are fighting. Before the war, Captain Marvel secretly gave Tony a superpower that she took from the other universe. They went through some days of the war but Tony\u2019s power was enough to fight against Thanos but not to defeat him and vice versa. So, they decided to play a number game.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-the-game-there-are-two-integers-maximumnumber-and-target-in-each-turn-one-player-can-choose-an-integer-and-add-it-to-runningtotal-the-player-who-makes-the-runningtotal-equal-to-or-more-than-the-target-wins\">In the game, there are two integers - \u2018maximumNumber\u2019, and \u2018target\u2019. In each turn, one player can choose an integer and add it to \u2018runningTotal\u2019. The player who makes the \u2018runningTotal\u2019 equal to or more than the \u2018target\u2019 wins.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-rules-of-the-game-are\">The rules of the game are:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. One can use any number between 1 and \u2018maximumNumber\u2019.\n2. One integer can\u2019t be used more than once.\n3. The running total = 0 initially.\n4. Both players play optimally.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"thanos-offered-tony-to-make-the-first-move-and-he-will-choose-the-two-integers-but-the-avengers-are-not-satisfied-so-all-came-to-a-conclusion-that-after-choosing-the-integers-if-tony-is-not-satisfied-with-the-two-integers-he-will-tell-thanos-to-rechoose-two-different-integers-tony-is-completely-exhausted-but-doesn-t-want-to-lose-as-it-can-cost-us-the-complete-universe-help-tony-to-figure-out-if-he-can-win-or-not-from-the-two-integers-that-thanos-chose\">Thanos offered Tony to make the first move and he will choose the two integers. But the avengers are not satisfied. So, all came to a conclusion that after choosing the integers if Tony is not satisfied with the two integers, he will tell Thanos to rechoose two different integers. Tony is completely exhausted but doesn\u2019t want to lose as it can cost us the complete universe. Help Tony to figure out if he can win or not from the two integers that Thanos chose.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers \u2018maximumNumber\u2019, and \u2018target\u2019, which denotes the maximum number that a player can choose, and the target number which whoever takes the running total more than the target wins.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print 1 if it is possible to win the game with the chosen integers.

Initially runningTotal = 0. He will choose any number between 2 and 5 and win the game. So, the output is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, Initially runningTotal = 0. It\u2019s Tony\u2019s turn, he has to choose any number between 1 and 5. Whichever number he will choose runningTotal will lie in the range 1 to 5. In the next turn, Thanos will choose a number between 1 and 5 which Tony didn\u2019t choose in his turn, and win the game.
