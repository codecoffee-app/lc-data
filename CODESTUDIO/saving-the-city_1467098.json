To perform this task they have divided their responsibility such that each one takes the responsibility of one city. Mr. Stark aka Iron Man got the responsibility of the city Malibu. The only safe place in the city is the Stark tower. Now, Iron Man has to shift trapped people from different parts of the city to the Stark tower.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"but-he-can-only-shift-one-person-at-a-time-due-to-less-time-he-wants-to-take-the-shortest-possible-path-help-him-to-find-the-minimum-distance-that-he-had-to-cover-to-rescue-all-the-trapped-people\">But he can only shift one person at a time.
