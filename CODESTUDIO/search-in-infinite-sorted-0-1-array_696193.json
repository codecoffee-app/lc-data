You have to find the index of the first occurrence of 1.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the array is 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\u2026 then, the first occurrence of 1 will be at index 4 therefore the answer here is 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>As the array size is infinite, the actual array won\u2019t be given to you. Instead, you will be able to access the array elements by calling a method named \u2018get\u2019.\n\nget(i) : returns the value present at index I.\n\nIndexing is 0-based. \n\nInstead of representing an infinite array in the input, we give the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the input itself. However, this input will be completely hidden from the user.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 64-bit integer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only input line contains an integer X, the index of the first occurrence of 1.
