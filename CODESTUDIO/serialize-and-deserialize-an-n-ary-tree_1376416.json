Deserialization is reading the tree back from the file.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Note that the structure of the tree must be maintained while serialization and deserialization. Also, you can use any method to serialize or deserialize the tree. You just need to see that the tree can be serialized into a string and further deserialized into the original tree.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases are as follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains elements of the N-ary tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is changed, we take -1. To get the next node\n\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next nodes of the current level and so on.\n\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null(-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the below-depicted tree, the input will be given as:\n1 -1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal-8653.png\"></img></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, you need to print the deserialized tree after its serialization.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.
