Due to excessive traffic on the website, he is asked to reduce the load by dividing the total traffic into two servers. He is given an array of integers \u201cload\u201d denoting the load by every process, He wants to divide the load into two parts such that the absolute difference between both the servers is minimum. As Sheldon is too busy with his other chores. Help him to find the minimum possible absolute difference.</h5>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>load = {10, 11, 7, 5}\n\nIn the given example, the total load can be divided such that the first server handles processes 1st and 3rd and the second server handles processes 2nd and 4th. Hence the absolute difference is abs((10 + 7) - (11 + 5)) = 1.\n\nSo the final answer is 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases, then each test case follows:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the total number of processes.\nThe next N lines each contain \u201cload[i]\u201d denoting the load by each process.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer \u201cans\u201d denoting the minimum absolute difference of the total load on the two servers.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10    \n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= load[i] &lt;= 50\n\nTime limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n7 3 9 12\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, we can divide the load between two servers like - {7, 9} and {3, 12}.
