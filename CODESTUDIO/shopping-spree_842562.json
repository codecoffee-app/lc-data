On reaching the place, she found a fascinating shop that has an unlimited quantity of each item they sell. The shop has N different types of items. However, here Preeti has a fixed budget and can buy a maximum of K items.

There is no restriction on different items having different quantities. Now, Preeti wonders the number of different ways in which she can shop today.
