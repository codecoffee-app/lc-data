Each node is associated with an integer label from 0 to N - 1. Each edge of this graph is coloured either red or green colour. Your task is to find out for each node in Graph G, it\u2019s shortest alternating distance from the node with label 0.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. This Graph may contain self-loops and parallel edges.\n\n2. The Graph will be directed which means it\u2019s edges are one-directional (from some node u to some node v).\n\n3. Alternating distance is the number of edges between two nodes such that the colours of each consecutive edge in the path are different.\n\n4. If there is no alternating path from a node X to the node with label-0 then print -1 as an answer corresponding to that node.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer &#39;T&#39;, denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers &#39;N&#39;, &#39;R&#39; and &#39;G&#39;, denoting the number of nodes, number of Red edges and number of Green edges in the graph respectively.\n\nThe next &#39;R&#39; lines of each test case contain two space-separated integers u and v,  denoting Red coloured directed edges from a node with label u to a node with label v.\n\nThe next &#39;G&#39; lines of each test case contain two space-separated integers u and v,  denoting Green coloured directed edges from a node with label u to the node with label v.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing &#39;N&#39; space-separated integers denoting the shortest alternating path length of each node from the node with label 0.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
