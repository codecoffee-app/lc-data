Here, you will implement a non - preemptive version (Non-preemptive Scheduling is a CPU scheduling technique in which the process takes the resource (CPU time) and holds it till the process gets terminated or is pushed to the waiting state. No process is interrupted until it is completed, and after that processor switches to another process). It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/image11-8883.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"we-have-four-processes-in-our-ready-queue-as-we-discussed-sjf-will-select-the-waiting-process-with-the-shortest-execution-time-to-execute-next-so-for-the-above-example-the-sjf-scheduling-of-the-processes-along-with-their-completion-time-waiting-time-and-turnaround-time-will-be\">We have four processes in our ready queue.
