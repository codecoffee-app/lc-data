As &quot;abc&quot; starts with a lower index (i.e. 0, &quot;cba&quot; start with index 2), we will print &quot;abc&quot; as our shortest substring that contains all characters of &#39;S&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of input contains a string &#39;S&#39; i.e. the given string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only line of output contains a string i.e. the shortest substring of &#39;S&#39; which contains all the characters of &#39;S&#39; at least once.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of.
