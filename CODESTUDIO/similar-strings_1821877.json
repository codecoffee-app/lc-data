The difference between the three strings is defined as \u2211|A[i] \u2212 B[i]| + |A[i] \u2212 C[i]| where |A[i] \u2212 B[i]| and |A[i] \u2212 C[i]| are the absolute differences between ASCII values of the characters at the position i in strings &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39; and &#39;A&#39; ,&#39;C&#39; respectively.
