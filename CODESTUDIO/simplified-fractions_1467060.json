Your task is to find all \u201csimplified fractions\u201d in the range [0, 1] whose denominator is less than or equal to \u2018N\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. A \u201cfraction\u201d is not a whole number. It is a part of a whole.\n2. When the numerator and denominator of a fraction are no longer to be reduced to any smaller number upon division by any common integer, the fraction is known as a \u201csimplified fraction\u201d. \n3. For example, 1/2 is a simplified fraction but 2/4 is not a simplified fraction as we can reduce 2/4 to 1/2. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integer, \u2018N\u2019, as described in the problem statement.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the \u201clist of strings representing all simplified fractions\u201d, as described in the problem statement. If there are no such fractions, then print \u2018-1\u2019 without any quotes.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n\n2. You can return the list in \u201cany order\u201d. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= \u2018T\u2019 &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= \u2018N\u2019 &lt;= 100\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1/2 1/3 2/3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for sample input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The only fractions 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3 satisfied all the conditions. \u20181/4\u2019 is not a valid fraction in this case because the denominator must be less than or equal to the \u20183\u2019.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>-1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-2\">Explanation for sample input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>There are no valid fractions available whose denominator is less than or equal to \u20181\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n",
