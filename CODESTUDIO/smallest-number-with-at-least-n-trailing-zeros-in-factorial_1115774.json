Your task is to find the smallest number whose factorial contains at least N trailing zeroes.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let N = 1. The smallest number whose factorial contains at least 1 trailing zeroes is 5 as 5! = 120.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The very first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line and only line of every test case contain an integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the number of trailing zeros.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, the smallest number whose factorial contains at least N trailing zeroes is printed.\n\nOutput for each test case is printed on a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just return the answer. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^8\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n1\n2    \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5\n10\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For the first test case, refer to the example explained above.\n\nFor the second test case, we have, N = 2.\nThe smallest number whose factorial contains at least 2 trailing zeros is 10 as 10! = 36,28,800.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3\n0\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>15\n0\n</code></pre>\n",
