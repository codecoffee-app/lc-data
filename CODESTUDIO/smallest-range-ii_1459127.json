Your task is to find the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: A = [1,3,6], K = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: B = [4,6,3]\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases given.\n\nThe first line of each test case input contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019. Where \u2018N\u2019 denotes the number of elements in the array while \u2018K\u2019 is the value to be added or subtracted from each A[i] so that the so formed list (array) \u2018B\u2019 has the smallest possible difference between its maximum and minimum element.\n\nThe next line of input for each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers (elements of the list/array).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case, print the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.\n\nPrint the output of each test case in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.
