If any two numbers have the same count of set bits, then in the sorted array they will appear in the order in which they appear in the original array. For example, let the array be { 2, 4, 3}, in this case, both 2 and 4 have the same number of set bits so the answer will be {3, 2, 4} and not {3, 4, 2}, because in the original array 2 appears before 4.\n\n2.
