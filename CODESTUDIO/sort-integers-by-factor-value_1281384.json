The factor value is the number of following operations it takes for the number to become 1.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-two-operations-are-as-follows\">The two operations are as follows:-</h4>\n\n<pre><code>If \u2018x\u2019 is even then \u2018x\u2019 will become \u2018x / 2\u2019.\n\nIf \u2018x\u2019 is odd then \u2018x\u2019 will become \u2018x * 3 + 1\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-need-to-sort-them-in-increasing-order-of-factor-value-i-e-if-two-integers-have-the-same-factor-value-then-sort-in-increasing-order-of-their-value-your-task-is-to-return-the-k-th-value-in-the-list-after-sorting\">Your need to sort them in increasing order of factor value i.e. if two integers have the same factor value then sort in increasing order of their value. Your task is to return the \u2018K-th\u2019 value in the list after sorting.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let\u2019s say you have an array/list [1, 3, 4, 5] and \u2018K\u2019=2. The factor values are [0, 7, 2, 5] respectively. Finally, our array will look like [1, 4, 5, 3]. Since \u2018K\u2019 is 2 return 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 representing the size of the array/list \u2018ARR\u2019 and position whose value in the sorted list you need to return.\n\nThe second line and the last line of input contain \u2018N\u2019 single space-separated integers representing the array/list elements.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the \u2018K-th\u2019 element in sorted list. \n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= N\n1 &lt;= \u2018ARR[i]\u2019 &lt;= 10 ^ 4\n\nWhere \u2018ARR[i]\u2019 is an element of array/list ARR.  \n\nTime Limit: 1sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 4\n1 2 3 4 \n2 1\n13 12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n12\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-1-explanation\">Sample Output 1 Explanation:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Test case 1:\n\nThe factor values of [1, 2, 3, 4] are [0, 1, 7, 2]. The array/list will become [1, 2, 4, 3] on sorting according to factor value.\n\nTherefore the answer is 3.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nBoth 12 and 13 have a factor value of 9. Since they have the same factor value we will sort them according to their value. Therefore on sorting \u2018arr\u2019 will be [12,13].\n\nTherefore the answer is 12.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4 3\n1 2 6 4\n4 2\n7 8 9 10\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>4\n10\n</code></pre>\n",
