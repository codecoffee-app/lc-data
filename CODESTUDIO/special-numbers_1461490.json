Your task is to determine the total number of special numbers present in the range, 1 to \u2018MAXVAL\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>A special number is a number, which when rotated 180 degrees, resembles some other number in the same range. Every digit of a special number must be a valid digit.\n\nThe digits, 0,1,6,8,9, when rotated 180 degrees, become 0,1,9,8,6 respectively. While the digits, 2,3,4,5,7, when rotated do not become any valid digit.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>\u20188196\u2019, when rotated 180 degrees, will become \u20189618\u2019. We can observe that all the digits of this number are valid. So, this is a special number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer, \u2018MAXVAL\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the total number of special numbers in the range, 1 to \u2018MAXVAL\u2019.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= MAXVAL &lt; 10^4\n\nTime Limit: 1sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n10\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>There are only two special numbers in the range from \u20181\u2019 to \u201810\u2019. These two numbers are \u20186\u2019 and \u20189\u2019. \n\nWe can not consider \u20181\u2019 and \u20188\u2019 because these numbers, when rotated, give the same number back so they can not be termed as special numbers. \u201810\u2019 can also not be considered as a special number because, after rotation, it becomes \u201801\u2019. Although, the numerical value of \u201801\u2019 is also \u20181\u2019, the representation of \u201801\u2019 is different from \u20181\u2019. \n\nHence, there are only two special numbers in this range.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n16\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n</code></pre>\n",

                "body": "Given an integer `MAXVAL`, determine the number of 'special numbers' present in the range from 1 to `MAXVAL` (inclusive). A special number is defined as a number that, when rotated 180 degrees, resembles a different valid number within the same range.  The valid digits for a special number are 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9, which transform to 0, 1, 9, 8, and 6 respectively when rotated.  Digits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are invalid for special numbers as they don't form valid digits after rotation.",
