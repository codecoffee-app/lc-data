Y has its own specific order and has no repeating characters. Your task is to arrange the characters of the first string i.e. X in such a way that the order of characters in X is exactly the same as in Y, which means if \u2018d\u2019 occurs after \u2018c\u2019 in Y then it should also occur after \u2018c\u2019 in X ( obviously if X has \u2018d\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 as characters in it ). All you have to do is, convert string X in the specific order with respect to string Y.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Both the strings have only lowercase English alphabets. \nThere may be more than one correct solution, you have to return any one of the possible solutions.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThen the T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the string X.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string Y.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the string X after converting string X in the specific order with respect to string Y.\n\nThe output of each test case is printed in a separate line. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.

If a character 'a' appears before 'b' in `y`, it must also appear before 'b' in the rearranged `x`.  The solution should return a valid rearrangement of `x` that adheres to the ordering specified by `y`.
