The first few sphenic numbers are 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, \u2026</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-that-for-a-given-number-n-you-have-to-determine-whether-it-is-a-sphenic-number-or-not\">Your task is that for a given number N, you have to determine whether it is a Sphenic Number or not.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let N = 42\nN = 2 * 3 * 7\nHere, 2, 3 and 7 are 3 distinct prime numbers. Thus, 42 is a sphenic number.\n\nLet N = 60\nN = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\nHere, 2, 3, and 5 are distinct prime numbers, but 2 is repeated twice. A sphenic number is a product of exactly 3 distinct primes. Thus, 60 is not a sphenic number.\n\nLet N = 15\nN = 3 * 5\nHere, 3 &amp; 5 are only 2 distinct prime numbers but, we need 3 distinct prime numbers. Thus, 15 is not a sphenic number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer &#39;T&#39; denoting the number of queries or test cases. \n\nThe first and only line of each input contains an integer &#39;N&#39;.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u2018Yes\u2019 if the given number is a sphenic number; otherwise, print \u2018No\u2019 in a separate line.\n\nThe output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, and it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100  \n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^8\n\nwhere &#39;T&#39; is the number of test cases and &#39;N&#39; is the given integer.\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n121\n138\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>No\nYes\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation\">Explanation:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For test case 1: \nN = 121\nN = 11 * 11\nAs it is not a multiple of 3 distinct prime numbers. Thus, 121 is not a sphenic number.\n\nFor test case 2:\nN = 138\nN = 2 * 3 * 23\nAs 2, 3 &amp; 23 are 3 distinct prime numbers. Thus, 138 is a sphenic number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>3\n78\n57\n125\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Yes\nNo\nNo\n</code></pre>\n",
