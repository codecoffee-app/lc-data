Now he is being provided few numbers in an array. Now he is being asked to split the array such that in all the subarrays the GCD of the starting and the ending element is greater than 1. As this procedure is expensive so Ninja needs to create the minimum number of subarrays that satisfy the above property. If it is not possible to create such subarrays then return -1.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-eg\">For eg:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Let arr[] = [2, 2, 4, 3, 6].

So we can create 1 subarray which is the minimum possible answer and we return it.\n\nIn the second test case, there is no possible subarray because the GCD of 1 and any element is always 1. So we cannot create any subarray. So we return -1 as our answer.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2 \n4\n4 5 6 2  \n2\n3 2 3 4\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2\n</code></pre>\n",
