You are given a list (array named \u2018strengths\u2019) of the strengths of the group of ninjas represented by numbers (integers). You have to determine whether those ninjas can be regrouped into two different teams such that the average strength of the two teams formed is equal.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You have to move each ninja of given strength from the given list into two separate teams (list) \u2018Team_A\u2019 and \u2018Team_B\u2019 such that the average strengths of \u2018Team_A\u2019 == \u2018Team_B\u2019.
