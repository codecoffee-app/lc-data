You need to split the given BST into two BST such that first BST has all nodes with values less than or equal to the given value \u2018K\u2019, and second tree has all nodes with values greater than the given value \u2018K\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure, with the following properties\n    a. The left subtree of any node contains nodes with the value less than the node\u2019s value.\n    b. The right subtree of any node contains nodes with the value equal to or greater than the node\u2019s value.\n    c. Right, and left subtrees are also binary search trees.\n2. It is guaranteed that all nodes in the given tree will have distinct positive integral values .\n3. The given tree may or may not contain a node of value equal to the given value \u2018K\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"example-below-the-tree-is-a-binary-search-tree\">Example, below the tree, is a binary search tree.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/1-8677.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"below-the-tree-is-not-a-bst-as-node-2-is-less-than-node-3-but-2-is-the-right-child-of-3-and-node-6-is-greater-than-node-5-but-it-is-in-the-left-subtree-of-node-5\">Below the tree is not a BST as node \u20182\u2019 is less than node \u20183\u2019 but \u20182\u2019 is the right child of \u20183\u2019, and node \u20186\u2019 is greater than node \u20185\u2019 but it is in the left subtree of node \u20185\u2019.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/2-8678.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. You have to split the given tree in such a way that the structure of both returned trees is similar to the originally given tree, i.e. if a parent node \u2018P\u2019 and child node \u2018C\u2019 lies on the same tree after splitting, then \u2018C must be the same child of \u2018P\u2019.\n2. If there is no valid tree, then return \u2018NULL\u2019 node in its place.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer &#39;T&#39; which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains elements of the tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a positive integer value \u2018K\u2019, denoting the value for splitting the given tree.\n\nFor example, the level order input for the tree depicted in the below image.     \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/3-8679.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>50\n13 72\n3 25 66 -1\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation\">Explanation :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Level 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 50\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 50 = 13\nRight child of 50 = 72\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 13 = 3\nRight child of 13 = 25\nLeft child of 72 = 66\nRight child of 72 =  \u2018Null\u2019\n\n\nLevel 4 :\nAll children are \u2018Null\u2019\n\nThe first not-null node(of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level.
