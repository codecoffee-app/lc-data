His friend presented him with a design made of various colors and gave him a stamp box. The various colors are given in the form of numbers. He can adjust the dimensions of the stamp box as per need.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-is-supposed-to-draw-the-given-design-under-the-given-conditions\">Ninja is supposed to draw the given design under the given conditions:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. Ninja can use one color at a time.\n2. Ninja can\u2019t use one color more than once.\n3. The stamp box is in the form of a rectangle. So, Ninja can only draw rectangles(or squares) by adjusting the dimensions of the stamp box.\n4. Once Ninja prints any color using the stamp box, the old color won\u2019t be visible and only the new color will be visible.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"ninja-is-very-busy-in-doing-some-other-stuff-but-he-can-find-some-time-if-it-is-possible-to-print-the-design-under-the-given-conditions-and-if-it-is-impossible-to-print-the-design-he-won-t-waste-time-on-it\">Ninja is very busy in doing some other stuff but he can find some time if it is possible to print the design under the given conditions and if it is impossible to print the design, he won\u2019t waste time on it.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"can-you-help-ninja-to-find-if-it-is-possible-to-print-the-design-or-not\">Can you help Ninja to find if it is possible to print the design or not?</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases.
