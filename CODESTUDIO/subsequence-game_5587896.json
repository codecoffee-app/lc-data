So his parents on his birthday gave him a task on strings as a present. The task is as follows:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"there-is-the-main-string-str-of-length-n-consisting-of-only-lowercase-english-letters-and-there-is-an-array-of-strings-arr-of-length-m-where-each-string-consists-of-only-lowercase-english-letters-now-shail-has-to-find-the-count-of-such-strings-in-the-array-arr-which-occurs-as-a-subsequence-in-the-string-str-and-tell-it-to-their-parents\">There is the main string \u2018STR\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019 consisting of only lowercase English letters, and there is an array of strings \u2018ARR\u2019 of length \u2018M\u2019, where each string consists of only lowercase English letters. Now Shail has to find the count of such strings in the array \u2018ARR\u2019 which occurs as a subsequence in the string \u2018STR\u2019 and tell it to their parents.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"but-shail-is-busy-with-his-birthday-celebration-and-cannot-solve-the-task-but-want-to-make-his-parents-happy-by-giving-them-the-answer-to-the-task-so-being-his-friend-he-asked-you-to-solve-this-problem-can-you-help-him\">But Shail is busy with his birthday celebration and cannot solve the task, but want to make his parents happy by giving them the answer to the task, So being his friend he asked you to solve this problem, Can you help him?.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-a-subsequence-of-a-given-sequence-is-a-sequence-that-can-be-derived-from-the-given-sequence-by-deleting-some-or-no-elements-without-changing-the-order-of-the-remaining-elements-for-more-details-please-visit-this-link\">NOTE: A subsequence of a given sequence, is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence\">For more details please visit this link</a>.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">EXAMPLE :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Input: \u2018N\u2019 = 5, \u2018M&#39; = 2, \u2018STR\u2019 = \u201cabcde\u201d , \u2018ARR\u2019 = [\u201cad\u201d, \u201ccb\u201d]\n\nOutput: 1\nIn this case, string \u201cad\u201d occurs as a subsequence in the string \u2018STR\u2019 and the index of the match is \u20180\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 respectively. Also, string \u201ccb\u201d isn\u2019t a subsequence because there is no occurrence of \u2018b\u2019 after the first \u2018c\u2019 at index \u20182\u2019.
