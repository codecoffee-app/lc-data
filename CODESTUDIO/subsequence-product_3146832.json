You find all the subsequences of size \u2018K\u2019 from the array \u2018A\u2019. Now for each of the subsequences, you calculate the product of all elements except the minimum element and the maximum element of the subsequence. After that you need to calculate the product of all these values.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-the-final-product-calculated-by-ninja-since-the-answer-can-be-large-output-it-modulo-10-9-7\">Output the final product calculated by Ninja.
