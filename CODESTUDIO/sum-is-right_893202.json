Standing at a particular row and column, he is interested in adding all the column values to the right of it and belonging to the same row and not including the present column value. He performs such operations at every row and column of the matrix.

There is only one element so the value at (0,0) becomes 3. Now moving to (0,1). There is no element to the right of it. So the value stored here will be 0. So the resultant matrix is [3 0].\n\nIn the second test case, we are taking a matrix of size 1*1, and standing at (0,0), we add the value of all column elements to the right. There is no one element to the right so the value at (0,0) is 0, so the final matrix is [0]. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n3 3\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n2 2\n1 2\n3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>5 3 0\n11 6 0\n17 9 0\n2 0\n4 0\n</code></pre>\n",
