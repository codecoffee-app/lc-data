Here, we will swap the 2nd bit with the 1st bit and the 4th bit with 3rd bit. The resulting binary number will be 0110. Hence, the answer is 6 in this case.\n\nFor the second test case : \nThe binary representation of 2 is 10. Here, we will swap the 2nd bit with the 1st bit. The resulting binary number will be 01 or 1.
