There will be \u2018T\u2019 times when you decide to make sweets. Each time you will make \u2018N\u2019 types of sweets numbered from \u20181\u2019 to \u2018N\u2019. Once you cook \u2018ith\u2019 sweet it has a freshness value \u2018N\u2019 and all the previous sweet\u2019s freshness values decreases by 1. After cooking each sweet, you will store it in the fridge to cool down and leave. The moment you leave the fridge, ants will steal some of the sweets(might be 0 as well). Since they love fresh sweets, they will steal all the sweets with a freshness value greater than \u2018N - S[i]\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"after-you-cooked-all-the-n-sweets-you-went-to-the-fridge-and-found-that-some-might-be-0-as-well-of-the-sweets-were-missing-you-have-to-print-an-array-of-length-n-containing-1-and-0-where-the-ith-value-will-be-1-if-ants-stole-that-sweet-else-it-will-be-0\">After you cooked all the \u2018N\u2019 sweets, you went to the fridge and found that some(might be 0 as well) of the sweets were missing.
