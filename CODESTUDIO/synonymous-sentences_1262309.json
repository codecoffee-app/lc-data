Your task is to find out all possible sentences that can be formed by replacing any word in the sentence with any of its synonyms.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. A word may or may not have synonyms.\n2. There can be multiple synonyms for a single word.\n3. All words only contain lowercase English letters.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then, the T test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N and M, denoting the number of pairs of synonyms in the list and the number of words in the sentence.\n\nThe second line contains 2*N space-separated words. For every, i from 1 to N, (2*i-1)-th and (2*i)-th words are synonyms of each other.\n\nThe third line contains M space-separated words which form the sentence.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print in separate lines all sentences that can be formed by replacing one or more words with their synonyms. \n\nPlease note that all the sentences must be printed in lexicographically sorted order.\n\nThe output of every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10\n1 &lt;= N,M &lt;= 8\n1 &lt;= |word| &lt;= 10\n\nWhere |word| denotes the length of any word that appears in the sentence.\n\nTime Limit: 1sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 5\nbright pleasant happy bright\ntoday is a pleasant day\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>today is a bright day\ntoday is a happy day\ntoday is a pleasant day\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation For Sample Input 1 :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>In the first test case, we can see that \u201cbright\u201d is a synonym of \u201cpleasant\u201d. We can also see that \u201chappy\u201d is also a synonym of \u201cbright\u201d. This means that \u201cbright\u201d, \u201cpleasant\u201d and \u201chappy\u201d are all synonyms. Hence we can form three different sentences using these words one by one. \n</code></pre>\n",
