You have an infinite number of friends. Since you can\u2019t remember all of their names, you have given each of them an \u2018id\u2019 numbered from \u20181\u2019 to \u2018\u221e\u2019. You decided to play a game \u2018T\u2019 times. Each time you select an even number of friends having \u2018id\u2019 from the range \u2018L\u2019 to \u2018R\u2019. You play the game by dividing all of your friends into \u2018(R - L + 1) / 2\u2019 teams, i.e. every team consists of two friends, and every friend is a member of exactly one team. But there is a problem. Two friends will only form a team if the gcd of their \u2018id\u2019 is 1. I.e. gcd(i, j) must be 1 and \u2018L\u2019 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= \u2018R\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-each-game-if-you-can-divide-the-friends-into-r-l-1-2-teams-print-the-resulting-pairs-i-e-pair-of-friend-s-id-who-are-forming-a-team-else-print-no-solution-exists-if-there-are-multiple-solutions-you-can-print-any-of-them\">For each game. If you can divide the friends into \u2018(R - L + 1) / 2\u2019 teams, print the resulting pairs,i.e. Pair of friend\u2019s id who are forming a team, else print no solution exists.

In each case, you select a range of friends with IDs from L to R (inclusive) and need to divide them into (R - L + 1) / 2 teams. A team can only be formed if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two friends' IDs is 1. Determine if it's possible to form the teams such that each friend is in exactly one team and the GCD condition is met. If a solution exists, output the pairs of friend IDs forming each team. If not, output that no solution exists.",
