Each ninja has his or her ability expressed as an integer. 3 candidates are great collectively if the product of their abilities is maximum. Given the abilities of \u2018N\u2019 ninjas in an array ARR[], find the maximum collective ability from the given pool of ninjas.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Given N = 5,\nand ARR[] = {1, 3, 5, 4, 2}\nTherefore, we can see that three ninjas with ability 3,4 and 5 will give us the maximum ability and will be called great therefore the output will be 60. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N, where \u2018N\u2019 is the array\u2019s size.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \u2018N\u2019 space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output format :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the maximum product of abilities that can be had with given candidates.\n\nThe output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5\n3 &lt;=  N &lt;= 3000\n-500 &lt;= ARR[i] &lt;= 500 \n\nWhere ARR[i] is the array element at index I.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note :</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
