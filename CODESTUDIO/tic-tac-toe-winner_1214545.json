Given an array \u2018moves\u2019 of size \u2018n\u2019,  where each element of the array is a tuple of the form (row, column) representing a position on the grid. Players place their characters alternatively in the sequence of positions given in \u2018moves\u2019. Consider that \u2018player1\u2019 makes the first move. Your task is to return the winner of the game, i.e., the winning player\u2019s name. If there is no winner and some positions remain unmarked, return \u2018uncertain\u2019. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw, i.e., when all positions are marked without any winner, return \u2018draw\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-rules-of-tic-tac-toe-are-as-follows\">The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows :</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"1-at-the-start-of-the-game-all-grid-positions-are-empty\">1. At the start of the game, all grid positions are empty.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"2-the-players-take-turns-to-place-their-characters-alternatively-into-empty-positions-player1-always-places-character-x-and-player2-always-places-character-o\">2. The players take turns to place their characters alternatively into empty positions. \u2018player1\u2019 always places character \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018player2\u2019 always places character \u2018O\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"3-a-player-will-never-place-characters-into-filled-positions\">3. A player will never place characters into filled positions.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"4-the-game-ends-when-all-the-positions-are-filled\">4.

The game also ends when any row, column, or diagonal contains three same characters (i.e., either \u2018X\u2019 or \u2018O\u2019). In this case, the winner is the player whose character occupies these three positions.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"6-once-the-game-ends-no-more-moves-are-played\">6.

After performing the given five moves, the grid contains three \u2018X\u2019s along a diagonal; hence the winner is \u2018player1\u2019.
