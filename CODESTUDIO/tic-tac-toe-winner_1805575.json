As always he started losing the game. So he approaches you to find the optimal move he needs to play at a given moment so that he can defeat his friend.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-the-current-state-of-the-game-with-a-3x3-grid-of-which-some-squares-are-filled-with-x-some-are-filled-with-o-and-the-rest-are-filled-with-_-which-means-that-this-square-is-empty-you-need-to-find-the-best-possible-score-our-ninja-can-get-and-the-position-of-the-optimal-move-he-should-make-you-always-start-first-and-your-symbol-is-x-the-scores-are-assigned-as-follows\">You are given the current state of the game with a 3x3 grid, of which some squares are filled with &#39;X&#39;, some are filled with \u2018O\u2019 and the rest are filled with \u2018_\u2019 which means that this square is empty. You need to find the best possible score our ninja can get and the position of the optimal move he should make. You always start first and your symbol is \u2018X\u2019.  The scores are assigned as follows:</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"win-1\">Win: 1</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"draw-0\">Draw : 0</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"lose-1\">Lose : -1</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Suppose the board looks as follows: \n\nX O X\nO O X\n_ _ _\n\n\nWe can see that if we put X at positions 3, 3 in the grid we win straightaway. Hence the best possible score is 1 (Win). If we put our symbol anywhere else we will not be able to achieve the desired score.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If there are multiple positions leading to the same score, choose the position with the minimum row. If there are still multiple positions, choose the one with the minimum column.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Each input is described by 3 lines each of which is a string of 3 characters denoting the state of that row of the grid.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Output 3 integers - the maximum score, the row and the column of the optimal move.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The size of the grid will always be 3.\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>X O X\nO O X\n_ _ _\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 3 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation For Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The value of the best move is 1 (i.e win). This can be achieved by making a move at position 3, 3. This way the column 3 will contain all X and we will get the required score. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>O _ O \n_ X _\nO X X\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>-1 1 2\n</code></pre>\n",
