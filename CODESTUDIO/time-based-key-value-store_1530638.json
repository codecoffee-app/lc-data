If there are multiple values of \u2018Val\u2019, return the value of \u2018Val\u2019 with the highest value of \u2018Timestamp\u2019 among the valid ones. If there is no valid value of \u2018Val\u2019 return \u201c-1\u201d as a string.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"timestamps-will-always-be-in-strictly-increasing-order\">\u2018Timestamps\u2019 will always be in strictly increasing order.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer \u2018N\u2019, representing the total number of queries.\n\nThen the next \u2018N\u2019 lines contain \u2018N\u2019 queries. A query can be of two types:\n1 Key Val Timestamp  \u2192 stores the Key and the Val along with the Timestamp\n2 TargetKey TargetTimestamp \u2192 returns the value of \u2018Val\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the value of \u2018Val\u2019 for each query of type 2 only, output the answer to the query in a single line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

So at this moment, we have a single data, i.e. {\u201cabc\u201d, \u201cdef\u201d, 10}. Then again, \u201cabc\u201d is added as a key along with \u201cghi\u201d as a value and 20 as the timestamp. Now we have two records, i.e. {\u201cabc\u201d, \u201cghi\u201d, 20} and {\u201cabc\u201d, \u201cdef\u201d, 10}.

So the output for this query is \u201cdef\u201d. Now again, the query of type 2 is called, and we have to find the value of \u2018Val\u2019 such that its key is \u201cabc\u201d and its timestamp value should be less than or equal to the target timestamp \u2018TargetTimestamp\u2019 i.e 5. So the output for this query is \u201c-1\u201d as there exists no value of timestamp, which is less than or equal to 5. \n\nFor the second test case, \nFirst, \u201cbbb\u201d is added as a key along with \u201cccc\u201d as a value and 5 as a timestamp. So at this moment, we have a single data, i.e. {\u201cbbb\u201d, \u201cccc\u201d, 5}. Then again, the query of type 1 is executed, and \u201cddd\u201d is added as a key along with \u201cccc\u201d as value and 5 as a timestamp.

First, \u201cfff\u201d is added as a key along with \u201cggg\u201d as a value and 13 as a timestamp. So at this moment, we have a single data, i.e. {\u201cfff\u201d, \u201cggg\u201d, 13}. Then again, the query of type 1 is executed, and \u201cfff\u201d is added as a key along with \u201chhh\u201d as value and 14 as a timestamp.
