For this purpose, he has \u2018Y\u2019 printing machines and \u2018Z\u2019 binding machines. The \u2018ith\u2019 printing machine takes \u2018printMachine[i]\u2019 minutes to print all pages of a comic book.

Start printing the pages of a comic book in an unoccupied \u2018ith\u2019 printing machine.\n2. After \u2018printMachine[i]&#39; minutes, the printed pages are taken from the \u2018ith\u2019 printing machine.\n3. After a non-negative amount of time, the printed pages of the comic book are placed in an unoccupied binding machine.\n4. After \u2018K\u2019 minutes, the pages are removed from the binding machine.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"assume-that-the-time-is-negligible-for-placing-the-pages-into-or-removing-them-from-the-machines-you-need-to-help-alice-find-the-minimum-time-to-publish-x-comics\">Assume that the time is negligible for placing the pages into or removing them from the machines.

After that, we can give it to the second binding machine, which will bind it till \u2018T=12\u2019.\nHence, will finish both books in 12 minutes.
