He found some stones in the treasure box and Ninja thought that these stones could be valuable. He went to a stone expert, and the expert gave him a list \u2018JEWELS\u2019 consisting of the names of all valuable jewels. Ninja made the list \u2018STONES\u2019 of all stones he found in the treasure. All stones and Jewels are represented by English characters.
