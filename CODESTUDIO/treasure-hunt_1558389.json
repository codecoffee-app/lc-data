Rome has a treasure box that Alex wants to open. Rome has N keys, each of which has a unique key number. She placed the keys in boxes numbered from 1 to N. Alex somehow cheated and came to know the key number that opens the treasure box. But he doesn\u2019t know the box number which contains the key. Alex knows that for any box \u2018i\u2019 the key in the ith box has a key number greater than the key numbers of the keys placed in any box j where j&lt;i.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"given-a-list-of-key-numbers-help-alex-find-the-box-number-which-contains-the-key-or-report-that-rome-has-not-placed-the-correct-key-in-any-of-the-boxes\">Given a list of key numbers, help Alex find the box number which contains the key.
