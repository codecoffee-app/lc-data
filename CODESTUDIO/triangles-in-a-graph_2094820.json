This is true for all vertices.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The very first line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018V\u2019 denoting the number of vertices of the graph.\nThe following \u2018V\u2019 lines of each test case contain \u2018V\u2019 integers representing the edges.\nIf the integer is 1, then we say that there\u2019s an edge from its row Number to column Number.
