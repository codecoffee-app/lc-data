Your task is to find out the \u2018N\u2019th Tribonacci Number. \u2018N\u2019th number in the Tribonacci sequence is defined as T<sub>n</sub> = T <sub>n - 1</sub> + T<sub>n - 2</sub> + T<sub>n - 3</sub>. Where T<sub>0</sub> = 0, T<sub>1</sub> = 1, T<sub>2</sub>= 1. Return the answer in mod of 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are given \u2018N\u2019 = 5, Here we know 0th, 1st and 2nd Tribonacci numbers are 0, 1 and 1 respectively. Therefore we can calculate the 3rd number as 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 and 4th number as 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 and 5th number as 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Hence the answer is 7.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"follow-up\">Follow Up :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Can you solve it in logarithmic time?\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first input line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \u2018N\u2019 representing Tribonacci number to find.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, representing the \u2018N\u2019th Tribonacci Number.\n\nPrint a separate line for each test case.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 \u2264 T \u226410\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
