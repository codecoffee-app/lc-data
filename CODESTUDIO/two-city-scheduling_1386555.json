The hall\u2019s capacity in which the exhibition is going to take place is only \u2018N\u2019. So, ninja thinks of organizing two exhibitions in 2 different cities, \u2018CITY_A\u2019 and \u2018CITY_B\u2019, each of capacity \u2018N\u2019. All \u20182N\u2019 people will come to the exhibition but in the group of \u2018N\u2019 in two different cities. Ninja wants your help in organizing this event.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-an-array-cost-where-cost-i-cost_to_ai-cost_to_bi-in-which-cost_to_ai-is-the-cost-of-the-ith-person-to-fly-to-the-city-a-and-cost_to_bi-is-the-cost-of-the-ith-person-to-fly-to-the-city-b-your-task-is-to-find-the-minimum-cost-of-organizing-the-exhibition-in-which-every-person-flies-to-a-city-such-that-exactly-n-people-arrive-in-each-city\">You are given an array \u2018COST\u2019 where \u201cCOST[i] = [COST_TO_Ai, COST_TO_Bi]\u201d, in which \u2018COST_TO_Ai\u2019 is the cost of the ith person to fly to the city A, and \u2018COST_TO_Bi\u2019 is the cost of the ith person to fly to the city B.
