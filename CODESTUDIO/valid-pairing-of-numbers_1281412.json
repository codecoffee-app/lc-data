You have to find the minimum number of swaps needed to make every even number \u2018E\u2019 (present in the list) adjacent to (\u2018E\u2019 + 1).</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>List = [3, 0, 2, 1]\n\nWe have to make \u20180\u2019 adjacent to \u20181\u2019 and \u20182\u2019 to \u20183\u2019. And, to achieve this we can swap \u20180\u2019 with \u20182\u2019.\n\nNew list = [3, 2, 0, 1].\n\nTherefore, the answer (minimum number of swaps) is equal to 1.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>There will be only distinct numbers present in the given list.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case will contain a single integer \u2018N\u2019 such that the size of the list is 2 * \u2018N\u2019.\n\nThe second line of each test case will contain 2 * \u2018N\u2019 integers separated by a single space that represents the elements/numbers present in the list initially.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print the minimum number of swaps possible to make every even number \u2018E\u2019 adjacent to (\u2018E\u2019 + 1).\n\nOutput for every test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You don\u2019t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.
