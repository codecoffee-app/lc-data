He gave him a string \u2018S\u2019 and asked him if it is possible to make this string palindrome by deleting one character from the string. Can you help the ninja to solve this problem?</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-are-given-a-string-s-of-size-n-you-have-to-determine-whether-it-is-possible-to-make-the-string-palindrome-by-deleting-at-most-one-character\">You are given a string \u2018S\u2019 of size \u2018N\u2019.You have to determine whether it is possible to make the string palindrome by deleting at most one character.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example</h5>\n\n<pre><code>If the string is \u2018AZBCDCBA\u2019, the answer will be YES as we can delete the character \u2018Z\u2019 and the remaining string is a palindrome. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer, &#39;T,\u2019 denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case has a single integer \u2018N\u2019 denoting the length of string \u2018S\u2019.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string \u2018S\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u2018YES\u2019 or \u2018NO\u2019 as is it possible to make the string palindrome by deleting at most one character.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.
