Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of input contains the elements of the tree in the level order form separated by a single space.\nIf any node does not have a left or right child, take -1 in its place. Refer to the example below.\n\nExample:\n\nElements are in the level order form. The input consists of values of nodes separated by a single space in a single line. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.\n\nFor example, the input for the tree depicted in the below image would be :\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/tree2-5139.png\" alt=\"Image1\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level. The second not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent node for the next two nodes of the current level and so on.\n\nThe input ends when all nodes at the last level are null (-1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note :</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree. \n\nThe sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space.
