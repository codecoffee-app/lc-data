Now, if we want to print the tree in the vertical order, then we will start printing the node values on the segment V1 and will continue the same procedure till the segment V5, and while printing the node values for any vertical level, we will check if there is any node to the left of the current level which does not lie on any of the line segment then we will include that node also in the current level. For instance node with value 7 can be included in the level V3, and the node with value 8 can be included in the level V4.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-vertical-traversal-for-the-above-binary-tree-would-be-6-4-2-7-8-3-9\">The vertical traversal for the above binary tree would be 6 4 2 7 8 3 9.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1) The root node will be fixed and will be provided in the function.\n2) Two nodes in the tree can have the same values, all values in the tree will be positive.\n3) While printing the nodes for any particular vertical level print them in sorted order, i.e. in the above example nodes in the level 3 are 2,7 and 8 so it will be printed as 2 7 8.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. \n\nThe second line contains the values of the nodes of the tree in the level order form ( -1 for NULL node) Refer to the example for further clarification.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example: \n    Consider the binary tree</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/screenshot-from-2020-10-09-12-55-45-5134.png\" alt=\"altImage\"></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"the-input-of-the-tree-depicted-in-the-image-above-will-be-like\">The input of the tree depicted in the image above will be like:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2 3\n4 -1 5 6\n-1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1\n\nExplanation :\nLevel 1 :\nThe root node of the tree is 1\n\nLevel 2 :\nLeft child of 1 = 2\nRight child of 1 = 3\n\nLevel 3 :\nLeft child of 2 = 4\nRight child of 2 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 3 = 5\nRight child of 3 = 6\n\nLevel 4 :\nLeft child of 4 = null (-1)\nRight child of 4 = 7\nLeft child of 5 = null (-1)\nRight child of 5 = null (-1)\nLeft child of 6 = null (-1)\nRight child of 6 = null (-1)\n\nLevel 5 :\nLeft child of 7 = null (-1)\nRight child of 7 = null (-1)\n\nThe first not-null node (of the previous level) is treated as the parent of the first two nodes of the current level.
