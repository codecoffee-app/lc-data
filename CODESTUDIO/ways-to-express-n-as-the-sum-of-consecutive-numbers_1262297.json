The task is to find the number of ways to represent \u2018N\u2019 as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>N = 9\n\u20189\u2019 can be represented as:\n2 + 3 + 4 = 9\n4 + 5 = 9\nThe number of ways to represent \u20189\u2019 as a sum of consecutive natural numbers is \u20182\u2019. So, the answer is \u20182\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1. The numbers used to represent \u2018N\u2019 should be natural numbers (Integers greater than equal to 1).\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which denotes the number of test cases. Then, the \u2018T\u2019 test cases follow.\n\nThe first line and only line of each test case contain a single integer \u2018N\u2019, where \u2018N\u2019 is the given number.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For every test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the number of ways to represent \u2018N\u2019 as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers. \n\nThe output of each case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000\n3 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 5\n\nWhere \u2018T\u2019 is the number of test cases, and \u2018N\u2019 is the given number.\n\nTime limit: 1 second\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>2\n21\n15\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>3\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"explanation-of-sample-input-1\">Explanation Of Sample Input 1:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>Test Case 1:\n\n\u201821\u2019 can be represented as:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n6 + 7 + 8 = 21\n10 + 11 = 21\nThe number of ways to represent \u201821\u2019 as a sum of consecutive natural numbers is \u20183\u2019. So, the answer is \u20183\u2019.\n\nTest Case 2:\n\n\u201815\u2019 can be represented as:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n7 + 8 = 15\nThe number of ways to represent \u201815\u2019 as a sum of consecutive natural numbers is \u20183\u2019.
