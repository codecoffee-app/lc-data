You are given a string \u2018PATH\u2019 representing the sequence of moves a virus can move. Your task is to find the number of distinct subsequences of those moves that lead from a given point \u2018X\u2019 to point \u2018Y\u2019 on the number line. If a virus is present at position \u2018P\u2019, then moving in the \u2018l\u2019 direction will take it to the \u2018P\u2019 - 1 position, whereas moving in the \u2018r\u2019 direction will take it to the \u2018P\u2019 + 1 position.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Subsequences are created by deleting 0 or more characters from a sequence without changing the order.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"example\">Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Let \u2018PATH\u2019 be: &quot;rrr&quot;\nLet \u2018X\u2019 = 1, \u2018Y\u2019 = 2, and \u2018R\u2019 = 10\nPaths are [&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;].
