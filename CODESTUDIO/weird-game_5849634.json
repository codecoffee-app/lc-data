For subsequent levels, the difficulty can either increase by one, decrease by one, or remain the same compared to the previous level (i.e., if level i is played at difficulty j, level i+1 can be played at j+1 (if j < M), j-1 (if j > 1), or j).  Completing a level awards points based on the chosen difficulty. POINTS[i][j] represents the points for level i at difficulty j. The game's score is the sum of points obtained after completing each level.
