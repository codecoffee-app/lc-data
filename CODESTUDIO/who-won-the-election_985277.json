There is a queue of voters and in this queue, some of them are supporters of A and some of them are supporters of B. Many of them are neutral. The fate of the election will be decided on which side the neutral voters vote. Supporters of A and supporters of B make attempts to win the votes of neutral voters.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-way-this-can-be-done-is-explained-below\">The way this can be done is explained below:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. The voter queue is denoted by three characters, viz {-, A, B}. The \u2018-\u2019 denotes neutral candidate, \u2018A\u2019 denotes supporter of candidate A and \u2018B\u2019 denotes supporter of candidate B.\n2. Supporters of A can only move towards the left side of the queue.\n3. Supporters of B can only move towards the right side of the queue.\n4. Since time is critical, supporters of both A and B will move simultaneously.\n5. They both will try and influence the neutral voters by moving in their direction in the queue. If a supporter of A reaches the neutral voter before a supporter of B reaches him, then that neutral voter will become a supporter of candidate A.\n6. Similarly, if a supporter of B reaches the neutral voter before supporter of A reaches him, then that neutral voter will become a supporter of candidate B.\n7. Finally, if both reach at the same time, the voter will remain neutral. A neutral vote cannot decide the outcome of the election.\n8. If finally, the queue has more votes for candidate A, then A wins the election. If B has more votes, then B wins that election. If both have equal votes, then it will be a coalition government.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-outcome-of-the-election\">Your task is to find the outcome of the election.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Given string- \u201cB--A-\u201d\n              B ---&gt;  B  A   &lt;--- A    B\n              -----------------------------&gt;\nOutput - B as B can move towards right only and A can move in left direction only. Thus B has 3 supporters in total while A have only 2 supporters. \n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>1. There are no test cases where all votes are neutral.\n2. The influenced voters do not move and hence does not have any influence over the neutral voters.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case will contain the string having characters \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, you need to print \u2018A\u2019 if A wins the election, \u2018B\u2019 if B wins the election or \u2018Coalition\u2019 if both have equal votes.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything.

So B gained and A both gained one supporter. Finally, B gains an extra supporter at the 4th position, as A will never be able to travel at that position. so overall B supporters are 3, and A supporters are 2. Hence B&#39;s supporters will win.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\nB---A\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Coalition\n</code></pre>\n",
