You brought \u2018X\u2019 candies while your friend brought \u2018Y\u2019 candies. Since you both were bored you decided to play a game where each of you will play one by one and you will start first. The game goes as follows :</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-the-ith-move-the-person-will-give-i-candies-to-the-other-person\">In the ith move, the person will give i candies to the other person.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-person-who-is-unable-to-donate-the-required-amount-of-candies-will-lose-you-are-required-to-find-out-who-will-win-the-game\">The person who is unable to donate the required amount of candies will lose. You are required to find out who will win the game.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For X = 1, Y = 2 the game goes as follows - \n\nYou will donate 1 candy. So you now have 0 and your friend has 3 candies.\n\nYour friend will donate 2 candies. So you now have 2 and your friend has 1 candy.\n\nYou are required to donate 3 candies but you only have 2 candies.\n\nHence your friend wins.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer \u2018T\u2019 denoting the number of test cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y which denote the number of candies you and your friend have initially.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, print \u201cWin\u201d if you will win the game and \u201cLose\u201d if you don\u2019t win the game.\n\nOutput for each test case will be printed in a separate line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"note\">Note:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= X, Y &lt;= 10^9\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec.\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n3 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Win\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-output-1\">Explanation For Sample Output 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The game proceeds as follows:- \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/unnamed-11467.png\" alt=\"link\"></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n100 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>Win\n</code></pre>\n",
