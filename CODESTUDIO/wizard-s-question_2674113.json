The head of the school, the great wizard, is taking your exam personally. He knows you like sorting, so he will ask you \u2018T\u2019 sorting questions. He will give you an array of length \u2018N\u2019 consisting of integers to sort in each question. But there is a catch; he asked you to divide the array into the maximum number of consecutive segments such that all segments are disjoint, and every index of the array must be included in some segment. Then you sort all the segments individually and merge them, forming a non-decreasing array of length \u2018N\u2019.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"e-g-let-an-array-be-2-1-4-5-3-we-can-divide-this-into-two-parts-2-1-4-5-3-and-after-sorting-both-the-part-individually-we-get-1-2-4-3-5-then-we-merge-them-forming-the-final-array-1-2-4-3-5\">E.g: let an array be [2, 1, 4, 5, 3]. We can divide this into two parts: [2, 1, 4] , [5, 3] and after sorting both the part individually we get : [1, 2, 4] , [3, 5], then we merge them forming the final array [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-the-above-example-is-not-optimal-as-the-final-array-is-not-sorted\">Note: The above example is not optimal as the final array is not sorted.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"for-each-question-you-have-to-tell-the-great-wizard-the-maximum-number-of-segments-in-which-you-can-break-the-array-and-still-get-the-final-array-sorted\">For each question, you have to tell the great wizard the maximum number of segments in which you can break the array and still get the final array sorted.</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>The first line contains \u2018T\u2019, denoting the number of tests.\nFor each Test :\nThe first line contains an integer \u2018N\u2019, denoting the length of the array.\nThe second line contains an array \u2018A\u2019 of length \u2018N\u2019.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For each test, print an integer, denoting the maximum number of segments in which you can break the array and still get the final array sorted.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"constraints\">Constraints -</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1&lt;= \u2018T\u2019 &lt;= 5\n1&lt;= \u2018N\u2019 &lt;= 10^5\n0&lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10^9  i \u2208  (1,N)\n\nTime Limit: 1 sec\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-1\">Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n5\n2 3 4 5 1\n5\n2 1 3 4 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-1\">Sample Output-1</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n4\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"explanation-for-sample-input-1\">Explanation for Sample Input 1:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>For case 1:\n    The segment will be [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], i.e. we take the whole array. There is no possible way to divide the array into two or more than two parts and still get the sorted array. Hence the answer will be 1.\nFor Case 2:\n    The segments will be [2, 1], [3], [4], [4], as we divided the array into four parts, so our answer will be 4.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-input-2\">Sample Input 2:</h5>\n\n<pre><code>2\n4\n4 3 2 1\n5\n2 1 4 5 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5 id=\"sample-output-2\">Sample Output-2</h5>\n\n<pre><code>1\n2\n</code></pre>\n",
