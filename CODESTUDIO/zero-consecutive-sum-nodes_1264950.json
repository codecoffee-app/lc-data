Recently she discovered about a Singly linked list. A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which we can traverse only in one direction, i.e., from Head to Tail. It consists of several nodes where each node contains some data and a reference to the next node.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"a-sample-linked-list\">A sample Linked List</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.codingninjas.in/image11-8412.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"but-she-doesn-t-like-those-consecutive-sequences-of-nodes-that-sum-to-0-as-she-is-a-beginner-she-requested-you-to-help-her-remove-such-consecutive-sequences-from-the-linked-list-formally-your-task-is-to-repeatedly-remove-consecutive-sequences-of-nodes-that-sum-to-0-and-occur-first-in-the-singly-linked-list-until-there-are-no-such-sequences\">But she doesn\u2019t like those consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0. As she is a beginner, she requested you to help her remove such consecutive sequences from the linked list. Formally, your task is to repeatedly remove consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 and occur first in the singly linked list until there are no such sequences.</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"input-format\">Input Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>The first line of the input contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 representing the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains space-separated integers denoting the values of nodes of the Linked List. The Linked List is terminated with -1. Hence, -1 is never a node value of the Linked List.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"output-format\">Output Format:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>For each test case, return the head of the linked-list denoting the values of nodes of the singly linked list after removing all consecutive sequences that sum to 0.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
