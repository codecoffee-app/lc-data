He invites his best friend to dinner and ask him to play his newly invented game.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He presents N numbers and an integer K. The game goes like this:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Each player will be given turn one by one. In each of their turn they can choose any number (non-zero) from the given array and divide (Integer division) it with K. The player who is unable to complete his move looses. Akash is very confident about his skills and knowledge about the game so he gives the first chance to his friends.</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input: </strong>nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 2\n<strong>Output: </strong>Akash\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>Friend will choose 2, then numbers\nwill become [1, 1, 3]. Akash will choose 3, \nthen numbers will become [1, 1, 1].Friend will \nchoose 1 then numbers become [0, 1, 1]. Akash \nwill choose 1 then numbers will become \n[0, 0, 1]. Friend will choose 1 then numbers \nwill become [0, 0, 0]. Now akash can&#39;t make \na move.</span>\n</pre>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input: </strong>nums = [2, 4, 6], k = 2\n<strong>Output: </strong>Friend\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>Akash will win the game.</span>\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br />\nYou don&#39;t have to read or print anything.
