Each station is dedicated to some sort of work like engine fitting, body fitting, painting, and so on. So, a car chassis must pass through each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory. The two parallel assemble line perform same task.<br />\r\nFrom any line one can switch another line diagonally. A 2D array <strong>T[2][]</strong> of size <strong>N</strong> is also given, which represent&nbsp; exit time to switch line 1 to line 2 diagonally.<br />\r\nAlso each assembly line takes an entry time e<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;and exit time x<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;which may be different for the two lines.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For more clarity, refer the following diagram<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/img-practice/AssembleScheduling1-1646927884.png\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The task is to&nbsp;computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.<br />\r\nOne can minimize the total time taken by performing following steps:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:18px\">&nbsp;A car chassis must pass through all stations from 1 to N&nbsp;in order(in any of the two assembly lines). i.e. it cannot jump from station i to station j if they are not at one move distance.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The car chassis can move one station forward in the same line, or one station diagonally in the other line.

A car chassis must pass through each of the `N` stations in order to exit the factory. Both assembly lines perform the same tasks. You are also given a 2D array `T[2][]` of size `N`, where `T[i][j]` represents the time taken to switch from line `i` to line `j` diagonally after completing station `j` on line `i`. Additionally, each assembly line has an entry time `e[i]` and an exit time `x[i]`, which may be different for the two lines. The goal is to find the minimum time required to build a car chassis by strategically choosing which assembly line to use at each station.  You can move from station `i` to `i+1` on the same line with no extra cost, or switch diagonally to the other line incurring the switching time `T[i][j]`",
