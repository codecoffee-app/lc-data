Let us take the two&nbsp;digits as <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Examples :</strong> <strong> </strong></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input: </strong>a = 1234, b = 67890\n<strong>Output: </strong>9876 4321\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>Reversing the given two numbers will give: 4321 and 9876. After swapping it would come as: 9876 and 4321.\n</span></pre>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input: </strong>a = 10000, b = 3254\n<strong>Output: </strong>4523 1\n</span></pre>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Constraints:</span></strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">0 &lt;= a, b &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></span></p>",
