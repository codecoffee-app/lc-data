The distance between their starting point and the city of Atlantis is N kilometers. They take turns manning the ship and each of them can steer the ship for 1, 2, or 4 kilometers in one turn. This should never exceed the remaining distance. The captain who is in charge of the ship when they reach Atlantis wins the game.<br />If Jelly starts as the captain in charge of the ship, find who wins the game, i.e., who will be in charge of the ship when they reach Atlantis given both Jack and Jelly play optimally.</span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input:</strong> N = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> JELLY\n<strong>Explaination:</strong> Jelly can cover 2 Km \nin his first turn itself.</span></pre>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input:</strong> N = 3\n<strong>Output:</strong> JACK\n<strong>Explaination:</strong> On his first turn Jelly can \ncover either 1 or 2km.
