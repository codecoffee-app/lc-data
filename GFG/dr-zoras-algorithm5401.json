Agent Natalia Romanoff is assigned the task to detect the pattern of the selection of destruction year, and help Avengers. Agent Romanoff observes from the past details that, year ........,1824, 1842, 1848, 1860........, 1912, 1918, ......2012 were Destructive Years. Now observing the pattern Agent Romanoff needs to design an algorithm to determine future Destructive Years.
