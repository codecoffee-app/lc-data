Transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input</strong>:\nN = 4\nmat[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},\n&nbsp;\\t    {2, 2, 2, 2}\n&nbsp;\\t    {3, 3, 3, 3}\n&nbsp;\\t    {4, 4, 4, 4}}\n<strong>Output</strong>: \n{{1, 2, 3, 4}, &nbsp;\n&nbsp;{1, 2, 3, 4} &nbsp;\n&nbsp;{1, 2, 3, 4}\n&nbsp;{1, 2, 3, 4}} \n</span></pre>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input</strong>:\nN = 2\nmat[][] = {{1, 2},\n&nbsp;\\t    {-9, -2}}\n<strong>Output</strong>:\n{{1, -9}, \n&nbsp;{2, -2}}\n\n</span></pre>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br />\nYou dont need to read input or print anything.&nbsp;Complete the function <strong>transpose</strong>() which takes matrix[][] and N as input parameter and&nbsp;finds the transpose of the input matrix. You need to do this in-place. That is you need to update the original matrix with the transpose.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(N * N)<br />\n<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(1)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Constraints:</strong><br />\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100<br />\n-10<sup>3</sup> &lt;= mat[i][j] &lt;= 10<sup>3</sup></span></p>\n",
