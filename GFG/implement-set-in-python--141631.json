You cannot access an element of set using indexing or slicing, but you can update the set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Some important functions in Set in Python:<br /><strong>add</strong>(): Adds an element to the set.<br /><strong>clear</strong>(): Removes all elements from the set<br /><strong>discard</strong>(): Removes an element from the set if present.<br /><strong>remove</strong>(): Removes an element from the set. If the element is not present, it raises error.<br /><strong>pop</strong>(): Removes and returns an arbitary set element. Raise error if the set is empty.<br /><strong>union</strong>(): Returns the union of sets in a new set<br /><strong>update</strong>(): Updates the set with the union of itself and others<br /><strong>len</strong>(): Return the length of set.<br /><strong>sorted</strong>(): Return a new sorted list from elements in the set.<br /><strong>sum</strong>(): Return the sum of all elements in the set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Let's implement these methods through a question. Given Q queries to do some operation on Set, the task is to perform all the queries in the Set as given below:<br /><strong>a. i element</strong>: Adds element to the set.<br /><strong>b.</strong> <strong>r element</strong>: Remove element from set.<br /><strong>c.</strong> <strong>s</strong>: Find sum of elements in set. Returns the sum of elements in Set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br />1 &lt;= S[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br />The task is to complete the functions given in user text area according to the query.</span></p>",
