The reciprocal of the letter is found by finding the difference between the position of the letter and the first letter &lsquo;A&rsquo;. Then decreasing the same number of steps from the last letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo;. The character that we reach after above steps is reciprocal.<br />Reciprocal of Z is A and vice versa because if you reverse the position of the alphabet A will be in the position of Z.<br />Similarly, if the letter is a small case then the first letter will be 'a'&nbsp;and the last letter will be 'z'. and the definition of reciprocal remains the same.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Note</strong>: If the character is not a letter its reciprocal will be the same character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input</strong>:\nS = \"ab C\"\n<strong>Output</strong>:\nzy X\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nThe reciprocal of the first letter 'a' is 'z'.\nThe reciprocal of the second letter 'b' is 'y'.\nThe reciprocal of the third letter ' ' is ' '.\nThe reciprocal of the last letter 'C' is 'X'.</span>\n</pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input</strong>:\nS = \"Ish\"\n<strong>Output</strong>:\nRhs\n<strong>Explanation:\n</strong>The reciprocal of the first letter 'I' is 'R'.\nThe reciprocal of the second letter 's' is 'h'.\nThe reciprocal of the third letter 'h' is 's'.</span>\n</pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />You don't need to read input or print anything.
