All the participants would be staying in the same hotel.In each room equal number of participants have to stay( can be 1 in a room).Also foreign and Indian cannot stay in the same room.&nbsp;Find the minimum number of rooms required,if in each room the same number of participants are to be seated.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Example 1:</span></strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input:</strong> N = 60, M = 84\n<strong>Output:</strong> 12\n<strong>Explaination:</strong> In each room we will keep 12 \nperson.
