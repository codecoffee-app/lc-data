Now, let's move on to work on two sets using some inbuilt functions which are used widely. They are:<br /><strong>union</strong>(): Used to find union() between two sets. It performs this using '|' operator.<br /><strong>intersection</strong>(): Used to find intersection() between two sets. It performs this using '&amp;' operator.<br /><strong>difference</strong>(): Difference of A and B (A - B) is a set of elements that are only in A but not in B. Similarly for B - A holds the same.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Now, Given some elements in two sets <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the task is to find the elements common in two sets, elements in both the sets, elements that are only in set <strong>a</strong>, not in <strong>b</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Example:</strong></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Input:</strong></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">b = {6, 7, 8, 2, 3}</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Output:</strong></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">2 3</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">1 4 5</span></pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br />Your task is to complete the function <strong>all_in_set()</strong>, <strong>common_in_set()</strong> and <strong>diff()</strong> to perform union, intersection and difference between two sets and return the elements in the set after each operation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br />1 &lt;= S[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></span></p>",
