He is practicing his shooting, but he has to reload his gun again and again.<br />\r\nYou are given his shooting a bullet and reloading activity in the form of a string s.<br />\r\nString s consists of 2 type of distinct characters: &#39;S&#39; stands for shooting one bullet whereas &#39;R&#39;&nbsp;stands for reloading the gun.<br />\r\nYou are also given an integer n, which is the bullet capacity of the gun. Each time Ishaan reloads the gun, it is filled up to n bullets.<br />\r\nGiven the string s and integer n, find out whether the activities are valid or not.<br />\r\nAssume that the gun is loaded upto its full capacity in the beginning of each test case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input:</strong>\r\ns = &quot;SSSRSRSS&quot;, n = 3\r\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\r\n<strong>Explanation</strong>: He has 3 bullets at the start,\r\nfires 3, reloades 3 bullets again, fires 1,\r\nreloades 3 and then fires 2.</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">\u00e2\u20ac\u2039<strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input</strong>: \r\ns = &quot;SSSSR&quot;, n = 3\r\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\r\n<strong>Explanation</strong>: He has 3 bullets at the start\r\nand tries to fire 4 without reloading. \r\nHence, not a valid activity.</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br />\r\nYou don&#39;t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function&nbsp;<strong>isValid()&nbsp;</strong>which takes the string s and the integer n as inputs and returns true if the string denotes a valid activity. Else, it returns false.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Expected Time Complexity:&nbsp;</strong>O(|s|).<br />\r\n<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:&nbsp;</strong>O(1).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br />\r\n1&lt;=|s|&lt;=10<sup>5</sup><br />\r\n1&lt;=n&lt;=10<sup>5</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
