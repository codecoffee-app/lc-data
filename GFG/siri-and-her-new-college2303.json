For her&nbsp;undergraduation studies she joins an engineering college GIT,&nbsp;Geekland Institute of Technology. The college has a&nbsp;semester wise system, a&nbsp;semester being of&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>&nbsp;days.&nbsp;Before her&nbsp;first day for the college Siri&nbsp;and her mom went to market for shopping and bought <strong>N</strong> dresses. Her mom&nbsp;told her that every<strong> M<sup>th</sup></strong> day&nbsp;she will bring her a new dress, but since the shops&nbsp;in the Geekland are open only in the evening, so Siri could only wear her new dress the next day. If on a particular day Siri didn&#39;t had a new dress to wear,&nbsp;she&nbsp;bunks&nbsp;that day off the college. Help&nbsp;Siri to know for how many days she will bunk her classes in a semester of <strong>K</strong>&nbsp;days.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input</strong>: N = 9, M = 3, K = 15\n<strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;\n2\n<strong>Explanation</strong>: For first 9 days Siri has new  \ndresses and she will wear them for 9 days, \nduring these 9 days she will get 3 more dresses\nso she will wear them on 10<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> day.\nOn 12<sup>th</sup> day she will get one more new dress to \nwear on 13<sup>th</sup> day. On 15<sup>th</sup> day she will get one \nmore new dress but she can&#39;t wear it before 16<sup>th</sup>\nday. For 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> day she does not have any\nnew dress, so she will bunk two days.</span>\n</pre>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>\n\n<pre>\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Input: </strong>N = 2, M = 2, K = 10\n<strong>Output:&nbsp;\n</strong>4\n</span></pre>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\nYou dont need to read input or print anything.
