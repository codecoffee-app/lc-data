Your task is to check if it is divisible as given below:<br />\r\n<strong>1.</strong> If it is divisible by <strong>11</strong>, print &quot;<strong>Eleven</strong>&quot;.<br />\r\n<strong>2.</strong> If it is divisible by <strong>3</strong>, print &quot;<strong>Three</strong>&quot;.<br />\r\n<strong>3.</strong> If it is divisible by <strong>2</strong>, print &quot;<strong>Two</strong>&quot;.<br />\r\n<strong>4.</strong> If not following the above three rules, print &quot;<strong>-1</strong>&quot;.<br />\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> <strong>If n is divisible by more than one of the above-given numbers, print the one which is the&nbsp;largest.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>Input:</strong>n = 3\r\n<strong>Output:</strong>Three</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>Input:</strong>n = 11\r\n<strong>Output:</strong>Eleven</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Task:</strong><br />\r\nYour task is to complete the function to check divisibility as required.
