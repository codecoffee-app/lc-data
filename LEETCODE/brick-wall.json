Each brick has a height of 1 unit, but the widths of the bricks can vary. The total width of each row is the same.\n\nYour goal is to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom of the wall such that it crosses the fewest number of bricks.  The line cannot be drawn along either of the vertical edges of the wall. A brick is considered 'crossed' only if the line passes through its interior, not along its edge.\n\nReturn the minimum number of bricks crossed by the vertical line.",
