You are given an array <code>cars</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>cars[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, speed<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>position<sub>i</sub></code> is the distance between the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that <code>position<sub>i</sub> &lt; position<sub>i+1</sub></code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>speed<sub>i</sub></code> is the initial speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car in meters per second.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the <strong>slowest</strong> car in the fleet.</p>\n\n<p>Return an array <code>answer</code>, where <code>answer[i]</code> is the time, in seconds, at which the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car collides with the next car, or <code>-1</code> if the car does not collide with the next car.
