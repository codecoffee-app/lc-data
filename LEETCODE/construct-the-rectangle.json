So, given a specific rectangular web page&rsquo;s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.</li>\n\t<li>The width <code>W</code> should not be larger than the length <code>L</code>, which means <code>L &gt;= W</code>.</li>\n\t<li>The difference between length <code>L</code> and width <code>W</code> should be as small as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Return <em>an array <code>[L, W]</code> where <code>L</code> and <code>W</code> are the length and width of the&nbsp;web page you designed in sequence.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> area = 4\n<strong>Output:</strong> [2,2]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \nBut according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> area = 37\n<strong>Output:</strong> [37,1]\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> area = 122122\n<strong>Output:</strong> [427,286]\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= area &lt;= 10<sup>7</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
