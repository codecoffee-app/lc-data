The tree is represented as a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.</p>\n\n<p>Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several <strong>guesses</strong> about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Chooses two <strong>distinct</strong> integers <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> such that there exists an edge <code>[u, v]</code> in the tree.</li>\n\t<li>He tells Alice that <code>u</code> is the <strong>parent</strong> of <code>v</code> in the tree.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bob&#39;s guesses are represented by a 2D integer array <code>guesses</code> where <code>guesses[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates Bob guessed <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> to be the parent of <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>.</p>\n\n<p>Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob&#39;s guesses, but just says that <strong>at least</strong> <code>k</code> of his guesses are <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Given the 2D integer arrays <code>edges</code>, <code>guesses</code> and the integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the <strong>number of possible nodes</strong> that can be the root of Alice&#39;s tree</em>.
