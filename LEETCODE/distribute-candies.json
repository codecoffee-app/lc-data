Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>The doctor advised Alice to only eat <code>n / 2</code> of the candies she has (<code>n</code> is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor&#39;s advice.</p>\n\n<p>Given the integer array <code>candyType</code> of length <code>n</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats </em><code>n / 2</code><em> of them</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies.
