You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>veganFriendly</code> filter will be either <em>true</em> (meaning you should only include restaurants with <code>veganFriendly<sub>i</sub></code> set to true)&nbsp;or <em>false</em>&nbsp;(meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters&nbsp;<code>maxPrice</code> and <code>maxDistance</code>&nbsp;which&nbsp;are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Return the array of restaurant <em><strong>IDs</strong></em> after filtering, ordered by <strong>rating</strong> from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by <em><strong>id</strong></em> from highest to lowest.
