            "content": "<p>We have <code>n</code> cities labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. Two different cities with labels <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> share a common divisor <strong>strictly greater</strong> than some <code>threshold</code>. More formally, cities with labels <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have a road between them if there exists an integer <code>z</code> such that all of the following are true:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>x % z == 0</code>,</li>\n\t<li><code>y % z == 0</code>, and</li>\n\t<li><code>z &gt; threshold</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given the two integers, <code>n</code> and <code>threshold</code>, and an array of <code>queries</code>, you must determine for each <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> if cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> are connected directly or indirectly.&nbsp;(i.e. there is some path between them).</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>an array </em><code>answer</code><em>, where </em><code>answer.length == queries.length</code><em> and </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is </em><code>true</code><em> if for the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> query, there is a path between </em><code>a<sub>i</sub></code><em> and </em><code>b<sub>i</sub></code><em>, or </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is </em><code>false</code><em> if there is no path.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/09/ex1.jpg\" style=\"width: 382px; height: 181px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [false,false,true]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The divisors for each number:\n1:   1\n2:   1, 2\n3:   1, <u>3</u>\n4:   1, 2, <u>4</u>\n5:   1, <u>5</u>\n6:   1, 2, <u>3</u>, <u>6</u>\nUsing the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the\nonly ones directly connected.

However, since the threshold is 0,\nall divisors can be used.
