            "content": "<p>There is a 2D <code>grid</code> of size <code>n x n</code> where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially <strong>turned off</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You are given a 2D array of lamp positions <code>lamps</code>, where <code>lamps[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the lamp at <code>grid[row<sub>i</sub>][col<sub>i</sub>]</code> is <strong>turned on</strong>. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.</p>\n\n<p>When a lamp is turned on, it <strong>illuminates its cell</strong> and <strong>all other cells</strong> in the same <strong>row, column, or diagonal</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given another 2D array <code>queries</code>, where <code>queries[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]</code>. For the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query, determine whether <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code> is illuminated or not. After answering the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query, <strong>turn off</strong> the lamp at <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code> and its <strong>8 adjacent lamps</strong> if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>an array of integers </em><code>ans</code><em>,</em><em> where </em><code>ans[j]</code><em> should be </em><code>1</code><em> if the cell in the </em><code>j<sup>th</sup></code><em> query was illuminated, or </em><code>0</code><em> if the lamp was not.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/19/illu_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 750px; height: 209px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [1,0]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off.

It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/19/illu_step1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 218px;\" />\nThe 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0.
