            "content": "<p>You are given two integers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code> and two integer arrays <code>speed</code> and <code>efficiency</code> both of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> engineers numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. <code>speed[i]</code> and <code>efficiency[i]</code> represent the speed and efficiency of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> engineer respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Choose <strong>at most</strong> <code>k</code> different engineers out of the <code>n</code> engineers to form a team with the maximum <strong>performance</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The performance of a team is the sum of its engineers&#39; speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the maximum performance of this team</em>. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 60\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nWe have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3\n<strong>Output:</strong> 68\n<strong>Explanation:\n</strong>This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team.
