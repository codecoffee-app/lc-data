A set of nodes `initial` are initially infected with malware. The malware spreads through the network such that if two directly connected nodes have at least one infected, both become infected. This process continues until no further infections occur.  Let `M(initial)` represent the total number of infected nodes after the spread stops.\n\nThe task is to remove exactly one node from the `initial` list. Return the node whose removal minimizes `M(initial)`. If multiple nodes achieve the minimum `M(initial)`, return the node with the smallest index.
