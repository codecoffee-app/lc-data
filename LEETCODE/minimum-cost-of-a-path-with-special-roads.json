This move has a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.\n- (1,2) -&gt; (3,3). This move uses the first special edge, the cost is 2.\n- (3,3) -&gt; (3,4). This move has a cost of |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| = 1.\n- (3,4) -&gt; (4,5). This move uses the second special edge, the cost is 1.\nSo the total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.\nIt can be shown that we cannot achieve a smaller total cost than 5.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> start = [3,2], target = [5,7], specialRoads = [[3,2,3,4,4],[3,3,5,5,5],[3,4,5,6,6]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> It is optimal to not use any special edges and go directly from the starting to the ending position with a cost |5 - 3| + |7 - 2| = 7.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>start.length == target.length == 2</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= startX &lt;= targetX &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= startY &lt;= targetY &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= specialRoads.length &lt;= 200</code></li>\n\t<li><code>specialRoads[i].length == 5</code></li>\n\t<li><code>startX &lt;= x1<sub>i</sub>, x2<sub>i</sub> &lt;= targetX</code></li>\n\t<li><code>startY &lt;= y1<sub>i</sub>, y2<sub>i</sub> &lt;= targetY</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= cost<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n",
