The roads are represented as a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a road between cities <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> that takes <code>time<sub>i</sub></code> minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.</p>\n\n<p>Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>passingFees</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>passingFees[j]</code> is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city <code>j</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, you are at city <code>0</code> and want to reach city <code>n - 1</code> in <code>maxTime</code><strong> minutes or less</strong>.
