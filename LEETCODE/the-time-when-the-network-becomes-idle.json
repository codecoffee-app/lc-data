You are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates there is a message channel between servers <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>, and they can pass <strong>any</strong> number of messages to <strong>each other</strong> directly in <strong>one</strong> second. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>patience</code> of length <code>n</code>.</p>\n\n<p>All servers are <strong>connected</strong>, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.</p>\n\n<p>The server labeled <code>0</code> is the <strong>master</strong> server. The rest are <strong>data</strong> servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers <strong>optimally</strong>, so every message takes the <strong>least amount of time</strong> to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages <strong>instantly</strong> and send a reply to the originating server via the <strong>reversed path</strong> the message had gone through.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of second <code>0</code>, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second <code>1</code>, at the <strong>beginning</strong> of <strong>every</strong> second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If it has not, it will <strong>resend</strong> the message periodically. The data server <code>i</code> will resend the message every <code>patience[i]</code> second(s), i.e., the data server <code>i</code> will resend the message if <code>patience[i]</code> second(s) have <strong>elapsed</strong> since the <strong>last</strong> time the message was sent from this server.</li>\n\t<li>Otherwise, <strong>no more resending</strong> will occur from this server.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The network becomes <strong>idle</strong> when there are <strong>no</strong> messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>earliest second</strong> starting from which the network becomes <strong>idle</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"example 1\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/quiet-place-example1.png\" style=\"width: 750px; height: 384px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], patience = [0,2,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 8\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nAt (the beginning of) second 0,\n- Data server 1 sends its message (denoted 1A) to the master server.\n- Data server 2 sends its message (denoted 2A) to the master server.\n\nAt second 1,\n- Message 1A arrives at the master server.

Servers can exchange messages directly in one second. An array `patience` of length `n` determines how frequently each data server resends its message to the master server (server 0).

The master server immediately processes incoming messages and sends replies back along the reverse path.  Each data server, starting at second 1, checks for replies. If no reply has been received, the data server `i` resends its message every `patience[i]` seconds.
