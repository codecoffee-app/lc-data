Each worker `i` has a `time` array: `time[i] = [leftToRight_i, pickOld_i, rightToLeft_i, putNew_i]`, representing the time it takes to cross from left to right, pick a box, cross from right to left, and put a box down, respectively.\n\nA worker `i` is considered less efficient than worker `j` if `leftToRight_i + rightToLeft_i > leftToRight_j + rightToLeft_j` or if `leftToRight_i + rightToLeft_i == leftToRight_j + rightToLeft_j` and `i > j`.\n\nThe movement of workers across the bridge follows these rules:\n\n1.  Workers arriving at the bridge while another is crossing must wait.\n2.  If the bridge is free, workers on the right bank cross first, with the least efficient worker going first (if multiple are waiting).\n3.  If the bridge is free and no workers are waiting on the right, and there are boxes remaining, workers on the left bank cross, again with the least efficient worker crossing first (if multiple are waiting).\n\nDetermine the time at which the last worker reaches the left bank of the river after all `n` boxes have been moved to the new warehouse.",
