            "content": "<p>You want to water <code>n</code> plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> from left to right where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plant is located at <code>x = i</code>. There is a river at <code>x = -1</code> that you can refill your watering can at.</p>\n\n<p>Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Water the plants in order from left to right.</li>\n\t<li>After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to <strong>completely</strong> water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.</li>\n\t<li>You <strong>cannot</strong> refill the watering can early.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You are initially at the river (i.e., <code>x = -1</code>). It takes <strong>one step</strong> to move <strong>one unit</strong> on the x-axis.</p>\n\n<p>Given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>plants</code> of <code>n</code> integers, where <code>plants[i]</code> is the amount of water the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plant needs, and an integer <code>capacity</code> representing the watering can capacity, return <em>the <strong>number of steps</strong> needed to water all the plants</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> plants = [2,2,3,3], capacity = 5\n<strong>Output:</strong> 14\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Start at the river with a full watering can:\n- Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it.
